> The existing Microsoft 365 (previously called Office 365) connectors across all cloud platforms are nearing deprecation, and the creation of new Microsoft 365 connectors will soon be blocked. For more information on the schedule and how the Workflows app provides a more flexible and secure experience, see [retirement of Microsoft 365 connectors within Microsoft Teams](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/).

**What are the next steps?**

To continue using Webhooks within Teams, please see the below information:

* To set up workflows in Microsoft Teams that automatically post to a chat or channel when a Webhook request is received, use the predefined templates or create from scratch using the When a Teams webhook request is received trigger. For more information, see [post a workflow when a webhook request is received in Microsoft Teams.](https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/office/post-a-workflow-when-a-webhook-request-is-received-in-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498).

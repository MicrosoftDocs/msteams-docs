> Microsoft 365 Connectors (previously called Office 365 Connectors) are nearing deprecation, and the creation of new Microsoft 365 Connectors will soon be blocked. For more information on the schedule and how the Workflows app provides a more flexible and secure experience, see [retirement of Microsoft 365 connectors within Microsoft Teams](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/).

> **How can you create a webhook in Teams**?
>
> * To automatically post to a chat or channel when a webhook request is received, use the predefined workflow templates or create a workflow from scratch using the **When a Teams webhook request is received** trigger. For more information, see [post a workflow when a webhook request is received in Microsoft Teams.](https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/office/post-a-workflow-when-a-webhook-request-is-received-in-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498).

>
> **If you've already built Office 365 Connectors**:
>
> * Create a Power Automate connector: Power Automate enhances the widely used Workflows apps in Teams. It's the scalable and secure approach to transmit data programmatically into and out of Teams. If you adopt this method, you can create workflow templates for posting alerts from your product to Teams channels. This approach simplifies user adoption of the new method. For more information, see [Power Automate for enterprise developers, ISVs, and partners.](/power-automate/developer/dev-enterprise-intro)
>
> * Update your Teams app: You can enhance your current Teams app. For example, you can enable users to set up proactive messages based on trigger events within your system. For more information, see [how bots can post to channels through proactive messages.](../bots/how-to/conversations/send-proactive-messages.md#send-the-message)
>
> **Known issues**
>
> * Workflows app can't post in private channels as a flow bot. However, it can post on behalf of a user.
> * Workflows support Adaptive Cards only. It doesn't support the older message card format that Office 365 Connectors use. The support for the use of message card format within Workflows becomes available from mid-October. For more information, see [how to convert connector message card format to Adaptive Card.](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/tools/message-card-to-ac-transformation)
> * Workflows don't offer third-party connectors such as DataDog and Jenkins.
> * Workflows can only be created in your default environment.
>
> **Limitations**
>
> Workflows are linked only to specific users (referred to as owners of the workflow) and not to a Teams team or channel. Workflows can become orphan flows in the absence of an owner if no co-owners assigned. To maintain continuity in the business process automated by the flow, admins can add one or more co-owners and grant them full control over the workflow. They can also add authentication for connections, if any, and enable the flow if it has been disabled. For more information, see [manage orphan flows](/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-automate/flow-management/manage-orphan-flow-when-owner-leaves-org).

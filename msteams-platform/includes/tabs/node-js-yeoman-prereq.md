## Prerequisites for apps

You must have an understanding of the following prerequisites:

- You must have a Microsoft 365 tenant and a team configured with **Allow uploading custom apps** enabled. For more information, see [prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).

  - If you don't have a Microsoft 365 account, you can sign up for a free subscription through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program. The subscription remains active as long as you're using it for ongoing development. See [welcome to the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program).

In addition, this project requires that you have the following tools installed in your development environment:

- Any text editor or IDE. You can install and use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for free.

- [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use the latest LTS version. The Node Package Manager (npm) installs in your system with the installation of Node.js.

- After you have successfully installed Node.js, install the [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) packages by typing the following command in your command prompt:

    ```bash
    npm install yo gulp-cli --global
    ```

- Install the Microsoft Teams Apps generator by typing the following command in your command prompt:

    ```bash
    npm install generator-teams --global
    ```

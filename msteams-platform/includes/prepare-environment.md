## Prepare your development environment

Before you begin, you must prepare your development environment. Custom app uploading must be enabled for the Microsoft 365 organization where you want to build your app. If you need a dedicated development tenant, you can sign up for the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program). For more information, see [setup your development environment](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).

## Prepare your development environment

The first thing to do is to prepare your development environment. Make sure custom app uploading is enabled for the Office 365 organization where you want to build your app. If you need a dedicated development tenant, you can sign up for the [Office 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program). For more information, see [setup your development environment](~/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).

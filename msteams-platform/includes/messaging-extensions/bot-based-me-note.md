> Agents provide a more flexible, intelligent, and future‑ready experience which enables richer reasoning, simpler development, and better alignment with the evolving Teams and Microsoft 365 platform. We recommend that you explore and build agents.

> For more information, see [build declarative agents](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-declarative-agent) and [build agents in Teams](../../agents-in-teams/overview.md).

> If you have an existing bot-based message extension, you can [extend it as an agent](../../messaging-extensions/build-bot-based-agent.md) as well.

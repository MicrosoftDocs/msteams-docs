**Use the latest TeamsJS to take advantage of the latest improvements and new feature support including Teams-only apps. No new features or improvements will be added to TeamsJS v1.13.0. New app submissions and updates now require TeamsJS v2.19.0 or later. For more information, see [TeamsJS library](../tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-library.md).*
***When upgrading your Teams personal tab or message extension app to manifest version 1.13 or later, it becomes available across Microsoft 365 hosts by default. To avoid partial loading in unsupported hosts and ensure a consistent user experience, define runtime requirements in the manifest to control where and how your app appears. For more information, see [Specify Microsoft 365 host runtime requirements in app manifest](../m365-apps/specify-runtime-requirements.md).*

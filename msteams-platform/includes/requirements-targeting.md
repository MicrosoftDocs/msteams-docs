### Specify host runtime requirements (developer preview)

To ensure your app always provides customers with high-quality experiences, you can tailor your app's behavior in applicable Microsoft 365 hosts, or omit it from surfacing in contexts that you're not ready to support. Use app manifest to specify any [dependency relationships](../m365-apps/specify-runtime-requirements.md#specify-relationships-between-app-capabilities-elementrelationshipset) across capabilities of your app, and specific [runtime requirements](../m365-apps/specify-runtime-requirements.md#specify-runtime-requirements-for-specific-app-capabilities-requirementset) of your static tabs, message extensions, and bots.

For more information, see [how to specify Microsoft 365 host runtime requirements in your app manifest](../m365-apps/specify-runtime-requirements.md).

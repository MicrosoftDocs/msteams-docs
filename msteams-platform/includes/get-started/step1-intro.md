The [Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/) developer platform makes it easy for you to extend Teams and integrate your own applications and services seamlessly into the Teams workspace. These apps can then be distributed to your enterprise or for teams around the world.

To extend Microsoft Teams, you will need to create a Microsoft Teams [app](~/concepts/apps/apps-overview). A Microsoft Teams app is a web application that you host. This app can then be integrated into the user's workspace in Teams.

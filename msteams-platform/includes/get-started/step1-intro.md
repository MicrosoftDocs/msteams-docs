To extend Microsoft Teams, you will need to create a Microsoft Teams [app](~/concepts/apps/apps-overview). A Microsoft Teams app is a web application that you host. This app can then be integrated into the user's workspace in Teams.

Teams App Studio is a new tool that will help you to configure your application. It also contains a react control library and configurable samples for cards. It has not been integrated with this walkthrough yet, but is available for you to use.  See [Getting started with Teams App Studio](~/get-started/get-started-app-studio).

    ## Verify version numbers for installed tools

    Use the following commands to verify that the installed versions for the tools are as needed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use the terminal window that you're most comfortable with on your platform. These examples use Git Bash (which is included in Git installation), but these scripts will run on most platforms.

    To verify the version numbers of tools installed:

    1. Open a terminal window. 
    2. Run the following command to verify the `git` version installed on your machine:

        ```bash
        $ git --version
        ```

        Output example: `git version 2.19.0.windows.1`
        
    3. Run the following command to verify the `node.js` version:
        
        ```bash
        $ node -v
        ```

        Output example: `v8.9.3`

    4. Verify the version number of `npm`:

        ```bash
        $ npm -v
        ```

        Output example: `5.5.1`

    5. Verify the version number of `gulp`:
        
        ```bash
        $ gulp -v
        ```

        Output example: 
        `CLI version 2.3.0`
        
        `Local version 4.0.2`

    6. Run the following command to verify the version number of Visual Studio Code:

        ```bash
        code --version
        ```

        Output example:
        `1.28.2`
        
        `929bacba01ef658b873545e26034d1a8067445e9`

    You can use a different version of these applications without any problem.


    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings.
    This space is also where you upload and test your custom app. 
    
    Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Enable custom app upload option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
      
    > [!NOTE]
    > Custom app upload is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you won't be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can upload a custom apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, custom app upload is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of example of what you see after signing up for the Microsoft 365 developer program.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

    Now you’ve got all tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

    You can continue to use this terminal window to run the commands that follow in this tutorial.

- title: Build your first Node.js app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    After you've cloned the repo for Node.js sample app, you can build and test the app in your local environment.

    In this page, you'll learn to:
    1. [Build and run your first app](#build-and-run-the-sample)
    1. [Test your sample app](#test-your-sample-app-in-local-environment)


    ## Build and run the sample

    After the repository is cloned, you can build the sample app.

    1. Open a terminal window.
    1. Run the change directory command in the terminal to change to the sample app directory:

        ```bash
        cd Microsoft-Teams-Samples/samples/app-hello-world/nodejs/
        ```

    1. Install all dependencies using the following command:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

        You should see a bunch of dependencies getting installed.

    1. Run the app using the following command after installation is complete:

        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

        When the Hello World app starts, it displays `App started listening on port 3333` in the terminal window.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you see a different port number displayed in the message above, it is because you have a PORT environment variable set. You can continue to use that port or
        > change your environment variable to 3333.

    1. Open a browser window and use the following URLs to verify that all the Hello World app URLs are loading:

        - `http://localhost:3333`

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/local-host.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing Node.js local host.":::

        - `http://localhost:3333/hello`

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/local-host-hello-nodejs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing Node.js local host hello page.":::

        - `http://localhost:3333/first`

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/local-host-first-nodejs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing Node.js local host first tab.":::

        - `http://localhost:3333/second`

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/local-host-second-nodejs.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing Node.js local host second tab.":::

    ## Test your sample app in local environment

    Remember that apps in Microsoft Teams are web applications exposing one or more capabilities. Make your app available on the internet so that the Teams platform can load it. To make your app reachable from the internet, you need to *host* your app.

    For local testing, you can run the app on your local machine and create a tunnel to it with a web endpoint. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is a free tool that lets you do just that. With *ngrok*, you can get a web address such as `https://d0ac14a5.ngrok.io` (this URL is just an example). You can [download and install](https://ngrok.com/download) *ngrok* for your environment. Make sure you add it to a location in the `PATH`.

    ### Create ngrok tunnel

    After you install ngrok, you can create a tunnel to deploy your app locally.

    1. Open a new terminal window.
    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3333:

        ```bash
        ngrok http 3333 --host-header=localhost:3333
        ```
        An ngrok tunnel is created. Here's an example of ngrok tunnel.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/nodejs-ngrok-tunnel.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing ngrok tunnel.":::

        *Ngrok* listens to requests from the internet and will route them to your app running on port 3333.

    To verify the app's local deployment:

    1. Open the browser.
    1. Load your app using the following URL:

        `https://<forwarding address in ngrok console session>/`

        Here's an example of the URL:

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/nodejs-ngrok-tunnel-verify.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing node.js app running locally on ngrok tunnel.":::

        You can try adding `hello`, `first`, or `second` to the ngrok tunnel url to view different tab pages of the app.

        Ngrok listens to requests from the internet and routes them to your app running on port 3333.        

    1. Make a note of the forwarding address in ngrok console. You need this URL to deploy your app in Teams.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you used a different port during [build and run](#build-and-run-the-sample), make sure you use the same port number to setup the *ngrok* tunnel.
        
        > [!TIP]
        > It's a good idea to run *ngrok* in a different terminal window to keep it running without interfering with the node app, which you might later have to stop, rebuild, and rerun. The *ngrok* session will return useful debugging information in this window. The paid version of *ngrok* allows persistent names.

        >[!IMPORTANT] 
        > If you use the free version of ngrok, your app will be available only during the current session on your development machine. It isn't available if the machine is shut down or goes to sleep. When you restart the service, it returns a new address. Then, you must update every location that uses the outdated address. Remember this step when sharing the app for testing.

    ## Build Node.js app package

    You can use `gulp CLI` to build the app package for Node.js.

    1. Open a terminal window.
    1. Ensure that you are in the directory where the `node.js` is cloned. This is the folder where `gulpfile.js` is placed. 
    1. Run the following command to build the Node.js app package.

        ```$ gulp```

        Here's an example of the command output:

        `[13:39:27] Using gulpfile ~\documents\github\msteams-samples-hello-world-nodejs\gulpfile.js`

        `[13:39:27] Starting 'clean'...`

        `[13:39:27] Starting generate-manifest'...`

        `[13:39:27] Finished 'generate-manifest' after 11 ms`

        `[13:39:27] Finished 'clean after 21 ms`

        `[13:39:27] Starting 'default'...
        Build completed. Output in manifest folder`

        `[13:39:27] Finished 'default' after 62 μs`

        The app package helloworldapp.zip is created. You can find the package file at the following path.

        `<path to the cloned repo>/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/samples/app-hello-world/nodejs/manifest`

        > [!NOTE]
        > Search for the app package file, helloworldapp.zip, if the location isn't clear in the tool you're using.

- title: Configure your first Node.js app using Developer Portal
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You can use [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) to upload the app package to Teams and configure app capabilities. Developer Portal is a Teams app that simplifies the creation and registration of an app. Install from the Teams Store!

    After you build and test your Teams app, you can configure and preview it using Developer Portal.

    Updating the app package includes:

    1. [Importing the app package to Developer Portal](#import-the-app-package-to-developer-portal)

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/nj-app-manifest.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing App manifest file in Developer Portal.":::

        The manifest file appears in the right pane.

    ### Configure your app's capabilities

    After you've imported your app into Developer Portal, the next step is to configure app capabilities. Developer Portal contains all the app information in different sections. It makes configuring the app capabilities easy.

    Using Developer Portal, you can:
    1. [Configure personal tab app](#configure-personal-tab-app).
    1. [Configure bot](#configure-bot).
    1. [Configure message extension](#configure-message-extension).

    #### Configure personal tab app

    To configure personal tab app:

    1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/ellipse-icon.png"::: icon on the **Personal app** card on the **App features** pane, and select **Edit**.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/nj-tab-saved.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing Hello tab and About tab details.":::

    #### Configure bot

    It's easy to add the bots functionality to your app. The Hello World sample app already has a bot as part of the sample, but you must register it with Teams.

    :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/devp-bot-no-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of image showing bot app imported with no app ID.":::

    The bot that was imported from the sample doesn't have an associated app ID. You'll need to delete it, and create a new bot. Developer Portal creates a new app ID, and registers it with Teams.

    Adding and configuring a bot involves:

    1. [Adding a new bot](#to-add-a-new-bot).
    1. [Adding bot to app](#to-add-bot-to-app).
    1. [Configuring bot scope](#to-configure-bot-scope).

    ##### To add a new bot

    1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/ellipse-icon.png"::: icon on the **Bot** card on the **App features** pane, and select **Delete**.

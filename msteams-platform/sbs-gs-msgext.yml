   Now, let's create your first message extension app.

   The message extension capability lets you interact with a web service through buttons and forms. Use the message compose area, command box, or a message directly in Teams client to search and initiate actions in an external system. Message extensions rely on bots to provide a dialog between the user and your code.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/your-helloworld-app-msgext.png" alt-text="Diagram shows Screenshot shows the different types of app features with message extension highlighted.":::

   There are two types of Teams message extensions:

   - [Search commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command.md): You can search external systems and insert the results into a message in the form of a card.
   - [Action commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command.md): You can present your users with a modal pop-up to collect or display information. Then, you can process their interaction and send the information back to Teams.

   Let's create a message extension app with a search command. First, set up a new Teams project for creating the message extension app.

   In this tutorial, you'll learn:

   ## Take a tour of the message extension app source code

   A message extension uses Bot Framework to interact with your service through a conversation. After scaffolding, view the project directories and files under **EXPLORER**.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/folder-structure-mex-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the files of the message extension app.":::

   | Folder / File | Contents |
   | --- | --- |
   | `teamsapp.yml` | Main project file describes your application configuration and defines the set of actions to run in each lifecycle stage. |
   | `teamsapp.local.yml` | Overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging. |
   | `.vscode/` | Visual Studio Code files for local debug. |
   | `appPackage/` | Templates for the Teams application manifest. |
   | `infra/` | Templates for provisioning Azure resources. |
   | `index.js` | Application entry point and `express` handler. |

   > [!Tip]
   > Familiarize yourself with bots and message extension outside of Teams before you integrate your app within Teams.

   ## Build and run your app in the local environment

   Now you can build and debug your first Teams message extension app locally. 
    
   ### Build and run your app locally

   1. Select the **F5** key in Visual Studio Code to run your application in debug mode.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams Toolkit is unable to verify a particular prerequisite, it prompts you to check.

        <br>
        <details>
        <summary>Learn what happens when you run your app locally in the debugger.</summary>

        When you select **F5**, the Teams Toolkit performs the following functions:

        1. Checks the following prerequisites:

           1. You're signed in with a Microsoft 365 account.
           1. Custom app upload is enabled for your Microsoft 365 account.
           1. Supported Node.js version is installed.
           1. Port required by bot app is available.

        2. Installs npm packages
        3. Starts Dev Tunnel to create an HTTP tunnel.
        4. Registers the app in Microsoft Entra ID and configures the app.
        5. Registers the bot app in Bot Framework and configures the app.
        6. Registers the app in Teams Developer Portal and configures the app.
        7. Starts the message extension app hosted locally.
        8. Starts Teams in a web browser and uploads the Teams app.
        
        </details>

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/f5-build-and-run-mex.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the debug process of the message extension app." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/f5-build-and-run-mex.png":::

        When you debug the app for the first time, Teams downloads the dependencies and builds the app. This process can take 3 to 5 minutes to complete.
        
   1. Teams opens in a browser window when the build is complete. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account, if prompted.

   1. A dialog box opens to let you add the message extension app to Teams. Select **Add**.
    
        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/add-mex-app-local-debug-latest.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to add the custom app in Teams." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/add-mex-app-local-debug.png":::

        Teams loads the message extension app.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/app-added-mex-local-debug-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the message extension app open in a Teams bot chat." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/app-added-mex-local-debug-2.png":::

        As message extension apps rely on bots for enabling communication between the user and the web service, your app loads in to a chat feature of a bot.

        - If you created a bot app before you created the message extension app, Teams loads the message extension in the bot app you created. Previous chat messages of the bot app are visible.
        - If you created a message extension first, Teams loads your app in the most recent chat that is open on Teams.

   Let's deploy your first message extension app on Azure using Teams Toolkit.

   ## Sign in to your Azure account

   Sign in to your Azure account to access the Microsoft Azure portal and provision new cloud resources to support your app.

   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vsc3)

   1. Open Visual Studio Code.
 
   1. Open the project folder in which you created the message extension app.

   1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the activity bar.

   1. Select **Sign in to Azure** using your credentials. Your default web browser opens to let you sign in.

        > [!TIP]
        > If you have the AZURE ACCOUNT extension installed and are using the same account, you can skip this step.
     
   1. Close the browser when prompted and return to Visual Studio Code.

   The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar lists the number of usable Azure subscriptions available to you. Ensure that you have at least one usable Azure subscription available. If not, sign out and use a different account.

   # [Command Line](#tab/cli3)

   1. Go to the project folder of your message extension app and open Command Prompt.

   1. Sign in to Azure with the following TeamsFx CLI command:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login azure
        ```

   1. Your default web browser opens to let you sign in. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

   Now, let's learn how to deploy the app to Azure using the Teams Toolkit.

   ### Learn what happens when you deployed your app to Azure

   Before deployment, the app runs locally.

      * The backend runs using Azure Functions Core Tools.
      * The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

   Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code of the app to Azure.

      * The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
      * The frontend app is deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.

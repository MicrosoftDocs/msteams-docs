    The Microsoft Teams activity feed enables users to triage items that require attention by notifying them of changes. You can use the activity feed notification APIs in Microsoft Graph to extend this functionality to your apps. 

    This step-by-step guide shows a feature where user can broadcast a message to all members of organization using activity feed notification.

    **Interactions of graph activity feed broadcast**

    * Broadcasts message for all the members.
    * Displays activity feed notification.
    * Broadcasts details available for members. 

    You'll see the following output:

    **To create tunnel for local web server**

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

     ```bash
     ngrok http -host-header=localhost 3978
     ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If you encounter **ERR_NGROK_4018**, follow the steps provided in the command prompt to sign-up and authenticate ngrok. Then run the `ngrok http -host-header=localhost 3978` command.

    1. Under **Manage**, select **Expose an API**.

    1. Select **Set**.

       ![App ID URI](~/assets/images/sbs-graphactivity-feedbroadcast/exposeanapi.png)

    The Microsoft Teams activity feed helps users to assess items that require attention by notifying changes. You can apply by using the activity feed notification APIs in Microsoft Graph to extend the functionality to your app.
    

    **Key features of activity feed broadcast**

    * Provides enhanced experience.
    * Keeps users up to date.

    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> Install the <br> **ASP.NET and web development** workload. | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the workloads. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK version 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. If you haven't installed the .NET 3.1 (or later) SDK globally, the portable version to be installed. |
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |

      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    Ensure you have the following accounts and set up your development environment:
    
    * [Microsoft](https://teams.microsoft.com/) account.
    * The Teams app must be installed for the recipient, either personally, or in a team or chat.
    * The Tenant ID for sending and receiving notifications must match.
 
    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also sideload and test the app.

    ### Check for sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. The function is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable Sideloading to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    To verify sideload apps in Teams:

    1. Go to **Microsoft Teams**.
    1. Select **Apps** > **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload an app**.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-app.png" alt-text=" upload an app in Teams.":::

    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/upload-a-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of Upload a custom app highlighted in red.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > Contact Teams administrator, if you can't upload a custom app.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. Select **Set-up E5 subscription** from the welcome screen.
    1. Set up administrator account. After you finish, the following screen displays.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft" border="true":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the new administrator account. Now you can select **Upload a custom app**.

       > [!Important]
       > Save the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** for future reference.
       
    **To create tunnel for local web server**

      Use ngrok or Command Prompt to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

     ```bash
     ngrok http --host-header=localhost 3978
     ```
     
       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-graphactivity-feedbroadcast/ngrok2.png" alt-text="New registration" border="true":::

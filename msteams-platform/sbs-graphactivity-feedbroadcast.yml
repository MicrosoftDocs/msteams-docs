    The Microsoft Teams activity feed notification helps users to assess items that require attention by notifying the changes. To extend the activity feed notification functionality to your app use the activity feed notification APIs in Microsoft Graph.
    

    Key features of the activity feed broadcast are:

    * Provides enhanced experience.
    * Keeps users up to date.
    * Broadcasts message for all the members.
    * Displays activity feed notification.
    * Broadcasts details available for members.

    This step-by-step guide helps you to broadcast messages and notify all the members of an organization using activity feed notification. You can see the following output:

    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022 and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK version 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. Use the latest version or install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> Or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm devDependencies). |

      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com).

    Ensure you've the following accounts and set up your development environment:
    
    * [Microsoft](https://teams.microsoft.com/) account.
    * The Teams app must be installed for the recipient, either personally, or in a team or chat.
    * The Tenant ID for sending and receiving notifications must match.

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A tenant is like a space or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also upload and test the custom app.

    ### Check for custom app upload option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. The function is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Custom app upload is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable custom app upload to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    To verify custom upload apps in Teams:

      1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps** icon.
      1. Select **Manage your apps**.
      1. Select **Upload an app**.
      1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the custom upload app in Teams.":::

         > [!NOTE]
         > Contact Teams administrator, if you can't upload a custom app.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. Select **Set-up E5 subscription** from the welcome screen.
    1. Set up an administrator account. After you finish, the following screen displays.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft" border="true":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the new administrator account. Now you can select **Upload a custom app**.

    Webhooks help Microsoft Teams to integrate with external apps. In Teams, the Outgoing Webhooks act as bot and search for messages in channels using **@mention**. The Outgoing Webhooks allow users to send messages to web services without performing the entire process of creating bots through Microsoft Bot Framework. The Outgoing Webhooks post data from Teams to any service capable of accepting JSON payload. 
    
    **Key features of Outgoing Webhooks**
    
    * Send notifications to any external web service.
    * Respond with rich text messages including cards and images. 
    * Receive messages in public channels and not within the personal or private scope.
    * Send HTTP POST to web service and get response. 
    
     > [!NOTE]
     > The Outgoing Webhooks can't access any other APIs, such as retrieve the roster or list of channels in a team.

    This step-by-step guide helps you to create Outgoing Webhooks in Teams. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/downloads) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
     
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/downloads).

    Webhooks help Microsoft Teams to integrate with external apps. In Teams, the outgoing webhooks act as bot and search for messages in channels using **@mention**. The outgoing webhooks allow users to send messages to web services without performing the entire process of creating bots through Microsoft Bot Framework. The outgoing webhooks post data from Teams to any service capable of accepting JSON payload. 
    
    **Key features of outgoing webhooks**
    
    * Send notifications to any external web service.
    * Respond with rich text messages including cards and images. 
    * Receive messages in public channels and not within the personal or private scope.
    * Send HTTP POST to web service and get response. 
    
     > [!NOTE]
     > The outgoing webhooks can't access any other APIs, such as retrieve the roster or list of channels in a team.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create outgoing webhooks in Teams. You'll see the following output:

       ![Manage](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/manage-team.png)

    1. Choose the **Apps** tab from the navigation bar.

       ![Choose](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/app-selection.png)

    1. Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

        ```bash
        ngrok http -host-header=localhost 3978
        ```

    1. From the window's lower-right corner, select **Create an outgoing webhook**.

       ![Outgoing](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/create-outgoing-webhook.png).

    1. Enter the following details:
     
        * **Name** - The webhook title in @mention tab.

        * **Callback URL** - The URL generated from ngrok that accepts JSON payloads and receives POST requests from Teams. To use the api/Sample or api/authenticatedSample, do the following:

            * For api/sample, copy-and-paste ngrok URL and append it with /api/sample.

            * For authenticated sample, copy-and-paste ngrok URL and append it with /authenticatedSample?id=contoso.

        * **Description** - A detailed string that will appear in the profile card and the team-level App dashboard.

        * **Profile picture (optional)** an app icon for your webhook.

    1. Select **Create**. The outgoing webhook is added to the current team's channel.

        ![Create outgoing webhook](~/assets/images/sbs-outgoing-webhooks/select.png)

    1. A `Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)` dialogue box appears. You can use the security token in **AuthProvider.cs** file to authenticate calls between Teams and any designated outside services. 

        > [!NOTE]
        > The outgoing webhook is available to the team's users, only if the URL is valid and the server, and client authentication tokens are equal. For example, an HMAC handshake.

# Power Automate

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-label](~/includes/collaboration-controls-deprecation.md)]

Power Automate can be used to automate workflows around your Collaboration Manager application. For example, automatically create tasks when a new record is created.

Collaboration control connector enables developers to access Collaboration control APIs by triggers or actions in automated workflows in Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Azure Logic apps. Collaboration controls are available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

In this version, the connector enables makers to set up triggers:

1. When a Collaboration session is created.
1. When a planner task is created or modified.

It also includes a set of Collaboration controls APIs and tasks that can be invoked with a flow. The connector actions are found in workflow step selections. The connector itself would be found on Custom connectors with configurable options. To use the connector in your solution, it’s necessary to create an Azure App trusted by your environment to execute the flows.

## Create an Azure App

In the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home) for Microsoft Entra management, sign in to your account with adequate permissions to add a user application to your environment with the following steps:

1. In the home page of Azure portal, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/azure-active-directory-home-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add a new App Registration.":::

1. Select **+Add** dropdown and then select **App registration**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/new-app-registration.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add new app registration.":::

1. In the app registration, set your application name and add the Web redirect URI to `https://global.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect`.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/register-an-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to register an application.":::

1. In the Implicit Grant and hybrid flows section, select both Access Tokens and ID tokens.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/authorisation-endpoint-tokens.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the tokens and ID tokens.":::

1. Select API Permission in the left pane and select **Add a permission**, and then search for **Dynamic CRM** permission.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/dynamic-crm.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add a permission.":::

1. Ensure to select **user_impersonation** in Permissions after selecting the Dynamics CRM.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/admin-consent-required.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to enable the checkbox user_impersonation.":::

1. In the Certificates & Secrets page, add a **New client secret** and save the value for later use while setting up the connector security.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/copy-new-secret-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to copy new secret value.":::

1. In the application Overview page, copy the **Application (client) ID** and save it for later use while setting up the connector security.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/application-client-ID.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to save client ID":::

Now your Azure app is all set and you need to add it as a user application in your environment.

## Add Azure app to Power Automate environment

# Create a new model-driven app with Collaboration controls for Teams

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-label](~/includes/collaboration-controls-deprecation.md)]

Collaboration controls are designed for [model-driven applications](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview). Collaboration controls are available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md). The following section covers how to create a model-driven app.

## Create a model-driven application

1. Open [https://make.powerapps.com.](https://make.powerapps.com/) or [https://make.preview.powerapps.com.](https://make.preview.powerapps.com/)

1. Select **Solutions** in the left pane.

1. Select **New solution**, so that you can provide a home for all your future customizations.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/new-solution.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the new solution, which provides a home for all your future customization.":::

1. Provide the name and publisher of your new solution, this solution is going to hold your Custom Collaboration Manager.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/collaboration-manager.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that provides publisher details of your new solution.":::

1. Select **Create**

1. After the solution is created, it appears in your list of solutions. Select your solution to open it.

1. Before creating your app, create a home for your data. select **New** > **Table** to get started.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/create-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot describes how to create a new table.":::

1. Give your table a name. Under **Advanced options**, select **Creating a new activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/new-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot describes how to create new activity.":::

1. Select **Save**.

1. After you've created your table, you can customize it by adding extra columns, relationships, and more (Optional).

1. Now you can create a new model-driven app by selecting **New** > **App** > **Model-driven app.**

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/model-driven-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows how to create a new model driven app.":::

1. Search and select the table you've created earlier.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/table-view-form-pages.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the table view form pages and can select the table that you've created.":::

1. Select **Add.**

1. Select **Publish** to save and publish your app.

1. Select **Play** to test out your new app.

Now you’ve successfully built a model-driven app.

## Add Collaboration controls to your application

Following are the steps to add Collaboration control capabilities such as Tasks, Meetings, Files, and Notes experiences to the app created:

1. To include the Tasks, Meetings, and Notes tabs you need to edit the Main Information form. To begin, go back to the explorer and select your solution.

1. Select the table you created in [Create a new model-driven app for Teams.](#create-a-new-model-driven-app-with-collaboration-controls-for-teams)

1. Go to the Forms tab for your table.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/forms-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the forms tab for your table.":::

1. Select the Information form of form type **Main** to open it in the form designer.

1. Once you are in the form designer, press and drag in a **1-column tab** from the **Components** section.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/components.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the components of power apps.":::

1. After selecting the tab, rename the tab to “Tasks” in the property pane.

1. Select the tab name to select the full section and select **Expand first component to full tab** in the Properties pane. This is required as the Collaboration controls are best viewed in full tab views.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/tasks-pane.png" alt-text=" Screenshot describes how to select first component to full tab.":::

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/expand-first-component.png" alt-text=" Screenshot describes how to expand first component to full tab.":::

1. Expand the Collaboration (Preview) category on the controls drawer and drag the Tasks (Preview) control onto the section in Tasks form.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/collab-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot describes how to preview control onto the section in tasks form.":::

3. Set the table to Activities & select Done.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/select-table-activities.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select the table to activities.":::

5. Select ‘Hide Label’ on the Properties.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/hide-label-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to select the Hide Label option.":::

1. The Tasks control appears now.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/new-collab-control.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows is an example of tasks control display.":::

1. Repeat the Tasks steps to add Approvals, Files, Meetings, and Notes controls to your app.
1. After you add all the controls, you'll see the controls rendered below in Form Designer. If a control doesn't render in Form Designer, for example shows a blank form, run your app in Power Apps and the presence of a 'configure' page or an 'empty state' means the control was successfully added.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/new-collab-approval.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Controls form the designer are successfully added.":::

1. You can now run your power app in Power Apps by selecting it.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/collaboration-manager-for-inspections-power-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows to run your power app by selecting Collaboration manager for inspections.":::

1. Create a new record by selecting **+ New** and then open the record.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/power-apps-open-the-record.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows to create a new record.":::

1. Now you can see views for each tab that appear similar to the following image:

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/tabs.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the view for each tab.":::

     > [!TIP]
     > The controls are only visible after a record is saved in the application. If the control tabs don't appear in your record, try to refresh your browser or republish the app from Power Apps.

Now you’ve successfully added the Collaboration controls to your application. You can now run your application in Power Apps and launch the controls. As settings aren't configured yet, you can't create entities such as Tasks, or Meetings until those are added.

## Define Settings for your Collaboration

You can define settings for Collaboration controls for the business entity such as the table created in [new model-driven app](#create-a-new-model-driven-app-with-collaboration-controls-for-teams).

> [!NOTE]
> For information on how to configure Collaboration Manager for Loans product, see [Collaboration Manager for Loans](/industry/financial-services/collaboration-manager/configure).

The settings that you can apply are as follows:

|Settings|Used by|
|---|---|
|Group ID|Tasks, Internal Meetings, Approvals.|
|Bookings business ID|External meetings using Bookings |
|Site ID|SharePoint files |
|Drive ID|SharePoint files|

> [!NOTE]
> Settings are critical to launch your app, so ensure that you follow the steps as suggested. If you have issues launching and saving the controls recheck the values.

You can get the Group ID by creating a new team or use an existing team in Microsoft Teams to host your application and create settings variables.

To create a new team, see [create a team from scratch](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-team-from-scratch-174adf5f-846b-4780-b765-de1a0a737e2b).

Use the following instructions to retrieve the Group ID of your Teams team for Approvals, Tasks, and internal Meetings:

1. Find your team in your teams list.

1. Select the ellipse **...** and select **Get link to team**.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/get-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot describes how to get the linked to the team.":::

1. Copy the link and record the value of `groupId` from the URL. You'll use this value at a later stage while defining the settings of your solution.

     `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3akk_TuKhjXu92yJvg4TZ10S6rouLSCgvHIb5NOOTfRjg1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=4310f270-1aa5-4089-99f3-47eb3b4d69ad&tenantId=b699419b-e0df-47e3-9909-24076fdcf68b`

Use the following instructions to retrieve the Retrieve the SharePoint Site ID and Drive ID for Files:

1. To use the Files control, you need to configure to an existing SharePoint site or create a new SharePoint site. To create a new site, see [create a site](/sharepoint/create-site-collection).

1. Now retrieve the Setting Values of Site ID and Drive ID, which can be called using the details in your SharePoint site.

     1. **Site ID**: Using [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer), sign in and give permissions to Directory.ReadWrite.All and User.ReadWrite.All

         :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/graph-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the Graph Explorer.":::

     1. Ensure that you replace hostname with your hostname and relative path to the site path and make a graph call to `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{hostname}:/{relative-path-to-site}`. Following is an example:
         1. If your Site URL = `https://myhostname.sharepoint.com/sites/MySiteName`
         1. Hostname = `myhostname.sharepoint.com`
         1. Relative path to site = `sites/MySiteName`

              :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/graph-call.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the Graph call.":::

            Graph call would be, `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/myhostname.sharepoint.com:/sites/MySiteName`.

     1. The response received is a Json object representing the Site, for example Site ID would be `abcdef.sharepoint.com,0abe7394-6fce-4dcc-9884-7eaceb48cd41,8cb86762-16cd-495e-87cb-893cfdf94054`.

     1. Save the Site ID value parameter.

     1. **Drive ID**: Using [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer), sign in and make the graph call to `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{site-id}/drives` with the value of Site ID that you saved earlier.

     1. A Json response is returned with a parameter value of type array or list of drive objects. Look through the Json for the Json object whose name parameter matches the name of your document library. Save the value of the Drive ID parameter.

To create meetings with users outside of your organization such as customers and use virtual visit features within your app you would need to provide a Bookings business. For more information, see [Microsoft Bookings](/microsoft-365/bookings/bookings-overview?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

## Add Settings to your Collaboration Manager app

To apply settings and explore the collaborative features of your app in Power Apps, open the application that you've created earlier. You would see a view page, where you can select the existing records or create new one. To begin with open or create a record.

You would need to add the Settings IDs that you've saved earlier for your application.

|Settings|Used by|
|---|---|
|Group ID|Tasks, internal Meetings, Approvals.|
|Bookings business ID|External meetings using Bookings |
|Site ID|SharePoint files |
|Drive ID|SharePoint files|

### Add Settings for Tasks, Meetings, and Files

1. Launch a control and you can see a window as following:

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/launch-window.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows the control window.":::

1. Select **Configure** and go to the General tab to add the Group ID.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/groupid-general.png" alt-text="Screenshot describes how to add the Group ID in General tab.":::

1. Open Files tab to add Site ID and Drive ID.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/collaboration-control/files-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot describes how to add the site ID and drive ID in files tab.":::

The Notes control doesn't require a setting value. Now you can create entities such as Tasks and Meetings in your application. If you're facing issues launching and saving the controls recheck the settings values.

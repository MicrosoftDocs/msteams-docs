# Virtual tables entity reference

Collaboration controls virtual entities and their attributes have a one-to-one mapping with a specific Microsoft Graph resource type. For example, the Graph Planner Task entities maps to the [Microsoft Graph Planner Task resource type](/graph/api/resources/plannertask). The virtual entity shares the same attributes as the resource type.

> [!NOTE]
> Collaboration controls are available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

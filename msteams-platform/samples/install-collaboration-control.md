# Install Collaboration controls

[!INCLUDE [deprecation-label](~/includes/collaboration-controls-deprecation.md)]

In this article, you'll learn how to install Collaboration Controls. The following are required to build and deploy Collaboration Manager applications using the Collaboration controls:

* **Power apps**: To build and run Model Driven Applications using the Collaboration controls.
* **M365 E3 or higher**: To deploy custom applications to Microsoft Teams and store tasks in Planner, files in SharePoint, and meetings in Outlook.

Collaboration controls are available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md). To install the components into a Power Platform environment, the following roles are required:

* System customizer
* Environment maker

For more information on role privileges, see [Configure user security in an environment](/power-platform/admin/database-security#predefined-security-roles)

## Install the Collaboration controls solutions

You install the Collaboration controls into your dataverse environment through [Microsoft AppSource.](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/mscm.collaboration-toolkit-preview?flightCodes=collaborationcontrols&signInModalType=2&ctaType=1)

You'll be able to configure and use the components within your own model-driven app only after browsing to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/mscm.collaboration-toolkit-preview?flightCodes=collaborationcontrols&signInModalType=2&ctaType=1)  and installing Collaboration controls into your dataverse environment.

Collaboration Controls include the following solutions:

|**Settings' solutions** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| Collaboration controls Settings | Hold the settings infrastructure that powers Collaboration controls |
| Collaboration controls Settings Objects | Provides predefined settings values that are used by the Collaboration controls.|

|**Collaboration solutions** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| Collaboration controls Tasks  | Includes the Tasks PCF (Power Apps component framework) control. |
| Collaboration controls Events | Includes the Events PCF control for Outlook and Teams meetings and bookings appointments. |
| Collaboration controls Notes | Includes the notes PCF control, which stores notes in Dataverse. |
| Collaboration controls Files | Includes the Files PCF control for accessing files on SharePoint. |
| Collaboration controls Core |Includes custom Collaboration APIs, the Collaboration Data Model and Virtual Tables for Events, Files and Task controls. |
| Collaboration controls Approvals | Includes the new Approvals PCF control. |
| Collaboration controls connector | Includes the new Collaboration Power Automate connector |

> [!NOTE]
> If you have an existing version of the controls installed in your environment, you might need to create a fresh environment and complete a new install to successfully upgrade to the latest version.

Before installation, you must be in a Power Platform environment or admin tenant. You need a dataverse environment with a database. If you don't have one, you need to [create a new one](/power-platform/admin/create-environment) to continue with the installation.

To install the solutions, browse to [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/dynamics-365/mscm.collaboration-toolkit-preview?flightCodes=collaborationcontrols&signInModalType=2&ctaType=1) and complete the following steps:

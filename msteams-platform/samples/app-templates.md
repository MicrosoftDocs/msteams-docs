Each contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization, providing a ready-to-use app that you can install and begin using immediately.

## SharePoint List Search app

Collaboration in Microsoft Teams quite often references information contained within items in a SharePoint list. Simply pasting a link to the item in question forces everyone to switch context away from the conversation, find the needed information, then return to Teams to continue the conversation. As the conversation continues typically people will have to switch back to the reference item multiple times to verify new comments and refresh their memories of the information contained within the item. This context switching creates a barrier to smooth collaboration, and is a recipe for things falling through the cracks.

To help alleviate this pain, we are happy to bring to you the List Search app template. Millions of users use SharePoint to power some of the core workflows in their organizations. However, collaborating around lists can be especially tedious. Using the List Search app template in Microsoft Teams, users can insert information from SharePoint list items directly within a chat conversation to alleviate the context-switching caused when simply inserting a link into a chat. The information is inserted as an easy-to-read auto-formatted card, helping your users stay engaged in the conversation.

This app also enables easy sharing of images/GIFs/stickers across teams without needing access to SharePoint sites or individual channels as storage and sharing mechanisms. For example, product teams can easily share product images and GIFs to social media, marketing and sales teams programmatically. One can also extend this app by triggering a notification flow to specific teams/individuals when new images/GIFs are made available.

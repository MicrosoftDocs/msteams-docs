# App templates for Microsoft Teams

App templates are examples of complete apps for Microsoft Teams that are open-source and available on GitHub. Each app template contains detailed instructions for deploying and installing that app for your organization. It also provides a sample app that you can install and start using immediately. The complete source code is also available, which allows you to explore it in detail or fork the code and alter it to meet your specific requirements.

All app templates are provided under the [MIT License](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-apps-eprescription/blob/master/LICENSE) terms.

> [!NOTE]
> You must license and support apps created from app templates for your users and organizations.

The key benefits of using App templates are:

* **Deploy directly to the cloud:** All app templates include deployment scripts that allow you to host all required services in Microsoft Azure or the Power Platform.
* **Recommended sample code:** The app templates conform to recommended best practices around security and infrastructure. All community submitted changes to the app templates are reviewed to ensure conformance.
* **Customizable and extensible:** While all app templates are deployed with minimal configuration, the entire code base and deployment scripts are provided to easily customize or extend them to fit your unique needs.
* **Detailed documentation:** All app templates have end-to-end documentation on solution architecture, deployment, and configuration steps.

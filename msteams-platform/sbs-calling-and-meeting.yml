    Calling and Meeting bot provides basic functionalities like create a call, join a call, transfer or redirect a call, join a scheduled meeting and invite the participants by integrating cloud communications API Graph API.
    
    Bots can interact with Teams calls and meetings using real time voice, video, and screen sharing. With Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings, Teams apps can now interact with users using voice and video to enhance the experience. These APIs allow you to add the following new features:

    * Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
    * Call control
    * Access to real time audio and video streams, including desktop and app sharing

    Create a bot and specify some additional information and permissions to use these Graph APIs in a Teams app.
 
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a bot with calling and meeting functionality. By the end of this tutorial you can achieve the following output:

    Register an application using App registration in the Microsoft Azure portal for your app to integrate with the Microsoft identity platform and call Microsoft Graph. Perform the following:

    1. Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your web server's endpoints.
    1. Create Azure Bot resource to register bot with Azure Bot Service.
    1. Create client secret that enables SSO authentication of the bot.
    1. Create a policy for a demo tenant user for creating the online meetings using PowerShell.
    1. Add API permissions for downstream calls.
    1. Create Bot channel registration in Azure account.
    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    **Create ngrok tunnel:**

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **Register an App in Azure:**

    1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) using your personal Microsoft account.
    1. Select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and select **App registrations** from the left pane and then select **New registration**.

    Microsoft Teams calling and meeting bot provides basic functionalities such as create a call, join a call, transfer or redirect a call, join a scheduled meeting, and invite the participants by integrating the cloud communications Graph API.
    
    Bots can interact with Teams calls and meetings using real time voice, video, and screen sharing. Teams apps can interact with users using voice and video to enhance their experience with Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings. These APIs allow you to add the following new features:

    * Use Interactive Voice Response (IVR).
    * Use call control.
    * Provide access to real time audio and video streams, including desktop and app sharing.

    Create a bot and specify additional information and permissions to use these Graph APIs in a Teams app.
 
    This step-by-step guide helps you to set up Teams calling and meeting bot. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. Use the latest version or install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Windows PowerShell](/microsoftteams/teams-powershell-install) | Install by executing all the commands. |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> Or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm devDependencies). |

     > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

  durationInMinutes: 5

    To register an application using the Microsoft Azure portal for your app to integrate with the Microsoft identity platform and call Microsoft Graph API, perform the following steps:

    * Create a ngrok tunnel to the endpoints of your web server.
    * Create Azure bot resource to register bot with Azure bot service.
    * Create client secret that enables single sign-on (SSO) authentication of the bot.
    * Create a policy for a demo tenant user to create online meetings using PowerShell.
    * Add API permissions for downstream calls.
    * Create bot channel registration in Azure account.
    * Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    * Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    **Create a policy**

    To create a policy that allows a demo tenant user to create online meetings using a PowerShell script, perform the following steps:

    1. Run Windows PowerShell PSI as an administrator and execute the script.

        ```PowerShell
        New-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity "<<policy-identity/policy-name>>" -AppIds "<<azure-client-id>>" -Description "Policy-description"
        Grant-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -PolicyName "<<policy-identity/policy-name>>" -Identity "<<object-id-of-the-user-to-whom-policy-need-to-be-granted>>"
        ```
     
        > [!NOTE]
        > If you're using the Windows PowerShell PSI for the first time, execute the following commands:
        >   * Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
        >   * Install-Module -Name MicrosoftTeams -Force -AllowClobber 

     1. Replace the following fields in **Windows PowerShell** script:

        |Field | Description |
        |----------------|-----------------|
        |policy-identity/policy-name | Name of the policy. |
        |azure-client-id | Microsoft App ID, which you generated while registering the app in Azure portal. |
        |Policy-description | Description of the policy. |
        |object-id-of-the-user-to-whom-policy-need-to-be-granted |  ID of the user for whom you need to generate the policy using the graph explorer. |

     1. To generate object ID, sign in to [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph) using the credentials to whom the policy must be granted.
     1. Select **Graph Explorer** from the tool bar.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/graph-explorer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft Graph with graph explorer highlighted in red.":::

     1. Select **Run query**. 
        A response is generated under **Response preview**.

     1. Copy the value of the `id` property from the **Response preview** and replace with the object ID in the PowerShell script.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/graph-explorer-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot of graph explorer displaying the response preview." lightbox="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/graph-explorer-run-query.png":::
       
     1. Execute the PowerShell script. 
     
     1. Run `Connect-MicrosoftTeams` and sign in with the credentials to whom the policy must be granted.

         :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/calls-and-meetings/sign-in-powershell-prompts.png" alt-text="screenshot of Windows PowerShell PSI displaying the sign in prompt.":::

     1. Run the following command in PowerShell to verify whether the policy is created successfully or not. Replace the policy name with your defined policy name.

        ```PowerShell
        Get-CsApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity “<<policy-identity/policy-name>>”
        ```

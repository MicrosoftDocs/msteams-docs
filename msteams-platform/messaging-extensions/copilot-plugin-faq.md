<summary>Why isn't Microsoft 365 Chat including my plugin in a response?</summary>

Ensure your app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) is descriptive. The app manifest helps in plugin matching in response to a user prompt. Also, ensure that you upload the app package to Outlook and interacted with the app, including authentication.

If the problem continues, use the thumbs down indicator in the Microsoft 365 Chat reply and prefix your reply with [MessageExtension].

<summary>What are the guidelines for Teams apps extensible as plugin for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365? </summary>

You can read the [Teams Store validation guidelines](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines.md#teams-apps-extensible-as-plugin-for-microsoft-copilot-for-microsoft-365) for Teams apps extensible as plugin for Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365.

<summary> What is the certification process?</summary>

After publishing the plugin, start the App Compliance flow in Partner Center. If [Publisher verification](/entra/identity-platform/publisher-verification-overview) is incomplete, ensure that the App Compliance flow is completed before Microsoft 365 Certification. Then, complete [Publisher Attestation](/microsoft-365-app-certification/docs/attestation), which gathers self-attested data about the plugin, company, and operations. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 App Compliance Program](/microsoft-365-app-certification/overview).

To start the [Microsoft 365 Certification process](/microsoft-365-app-certification/docs/certification), upload initial documents that define the assessment scope for the plugin and operating environment. Depending on the scope, provide evidence for specific controls related to application security, operational security, and data handling or privacy. If you build your plugin on Azure, you can use the App Compliance Automation Tool (ACAT) to scan the environment and generate evidence for several controls, reducing the manual workload. For more information, see [App Compliance Automation Tool for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365-app-certification/docs/acat-overview).

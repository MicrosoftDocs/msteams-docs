# Build API-based message extension

> [!NOTE]
> API-based message extensions only support search commands.

API-based message extensions are a Microsoft Teams app capability that integrates external APIs directly into Teams, enhancing your app's usability and offering a seamless user experience. API-based message extensions support search commands and can be used to fetch and display data from external services within Teams, streamlining workflows by reducing the need to switch between applications.

Before you get started, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

</br>
<details><summary id="oad">1. OpenAPI Description (OAD) </summary>

Ensure that you adhere to following guidelines for OpenAPI Description (OAD) document:

* OpenAPI versions 2.0 and 3.0.x are supported.
* JSON and YAML are the supported formats.
* The request body, if present, must be application/Json.
* Define an HTTPS protocol server URL for the `servers.url` property.
* Only POST and GET HTTP methods are supported.
* The OpenAPI Description document must have an `operationId`.
* Only one required parameter without a default value is allowed.
* A required parameter with a default value is considered optional.
* Users must not enter a parameter for a header or cookie.
* The operation must not have a required header or cookie parameters without default values.
* Ensure that there are no remote references in the OpenAPI Description document.
* Constructing arrays for the request isn’t supported; however, nested objects within a JSON request body are supported.
* Teams doesn't support the `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`, and `not` (swagger.io) constructs.

The following code is an example of an OpenAPI Description document:

```yml
openapi: 3.0.1

<details><summary id="app-manifest">2. App manifest</summary>

Ensure that you adhere to following guidelines for app manifest:

* Set the app manifest version to `1.17`.
* Set `composeExtensions.composeExtensionType` to `apiBased`.
* Define `composeExtensions.apiSpecificationFile` as the relative path to the OpenAPI Description file within the folder. This links the app manifest to the API specification.
* Define `apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile` as the relative path to the response rendering template. This specifies the location of the template used for rendering API responses.
* Each command must have a link to the response rendering template. This connects each command to its corresponding response format.
* The `Commands.id` property in the app manifest must match the `operationId` in the OpenAPI Description.
* If a required parameter is without a default value, the command `parameters.name` in the app manifest must match the `parameters.name` in the OpenAPI Description document.
* If there’s no required parameter, the command `parameters.name` in the app manifest must match the optional `parameters.name` in the OpenAPI Description.
* Make sure that the parameters for each command match exactly with the names of the parameters defined for the operation in the OpenAPI spec.
* A [response rendering template](#response-template) must be defined per command, which is used to convert responses from an API.
* The command and parameter descriptions must not exceed 128 characters.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Teams supports Adaptive Cards up to version 1.5. When using Adaptive Card designer, ensure that you change the target version to 1.5.

* **Define the schema reference URL** in the `$schema` property to establish the structure of your template to the [response rendering template schema](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.17/MicrosoftTeams.ResponseRenderingTemplate.schema.json).
* **The supported values for `responseLayout`** are `list` and `grid`, which determine how the response is visually presented. For more information on the layout, see [respond to user requests](how-to/search-commands/respond-to-search.md#respond-to-user-requests).
* **A `jsonPath` is rerequired** for arrays or when the data for the Adaptive Card isn't the root object. For example, if your data is nested under `productDetails`, your JSON path would be `productDetails`.
* **Define `jsonPath` as the path** to the relevant data or array in the API response. If the path points to an array, then each entry in the array binds with the Adaptive Card template and returns as a separate result. *[Optional]*
* **Get a sample response** for validating the response rendering template. This serves as a test to ensure your template works as expected.
* **Use tools such as Fiddler or Postman** to call the API and ensure that the request and the response are valid. This step is crucial for troubleshooting and confirming that your API is functioning correctly.
* **You can use the Adaptive Card Designer** to bind the API response to the response rendering template and preview the Adaptive Card. Insert the Adaptive Card template in the **CARD PAYLOAD EDITOR** and insert the sample response entry in the **SAMPLE DATA EDITOR**.

  **Preview Card**

A preview card template in the response rendering template schema is used to map JSON responses to a preview card that users see when they select a search result. The preview card then expands into an Adaptive Card in the message compose box. The preview card template is part of the response rendering template, which also includes an Adaptive Card template and metadata.

  :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-message-extension-preview-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of compose extension displaying an array of preview cards when searching for a specific word. In this case, searching for 'a' in the 'SME test app' returns five cards showing 'Title', 'Description' (truncated) and 'AssignedTo' properties and values in each one.":::

 **Expanded Adaptive Card**

  :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-message-extension-expanded-adaptive-card.png" alt-text="Example of how the Adaptive Card looks like expanded once a user selects a preview card.

#### Parameters

|Property  |Type  |Description  |Required  |
|--------- |---------|---------|---------|
|`version` |  `string` | The schema version of the current response rendering template.        |  Yes       |
|`jsonPath`     | `string`        | The path to the relevant section in the results to which the responseCardTemplate and previewCardTemplate should be applied. If not set, the root object is treated as the relevant section. If the relevant section is an array, each entry is mapped to the responseCardTemplate and the previewCardTemplate.        |   No      |
|`responseLayout`    | `responseLayoutType`        |  Specifies the layout of the results in the message extension flyout. The supported types are `list` and `grid`.       |    Yes     |
|`responseCardTemplate`    |  `adaptiveCardTemplate`  | A template for creating an Adaptive Card from a result entry.      |   Yes      |
|`previewCardTemplate`     |  `previewCardTemplate`       | A template for creating a preview card from a result entry. The resulting preview card is displayed in the message extension flyout menu.        |  Yes       |

#### Json path

The [JSON path](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/QueryJsonSelectToken.htm) is optional but should be used for arrays or where the object to be used as the data for the adaptive card isn't the root object. The JSON path should follow the format defined by Newtonsoft. This tool can be used. You can use the [JSON tool](https://jsonpath.com/) to validate a JSON path is correct given an example JSON token. If the JSON path points to an array, then each entry in that array is bound with the adaptive card template and returns as separate results.

**Example**
Let's say you have the below JSON for a list of products and you want to create a card result for each entry.

```json
{
   "version": "1.0",
   "title": "All Products",
   "warehouse": {
      "products": [
        ...
      ]
   }
}
```

As you can see, the array of results is under "products", which is nested under "warehouse", so the JSON path would be "warehouse.products".

Use <https://adaptivecards.io/designer/> to preview the adaptive card by inserting the template into Card Payload Editor, and take a sample response entry from your array or for your object and insert it into the Same Data editor on the right. Make sure that the card renders properly and is to your liking.
Note that Teams supports cards up to version 1.5 while the designer supports 1.6.

#### OpenAPI schema conversion

> [!NOTE]
> We send an accept-language header in the HTTP request that is sent to the endpoint defined in the OpenAPI description document. The accept-language is based on the Teams client locale and can be used by the developer for returning back a localized response.

The following data types in the OpenAPI description document are converted into elements within an Adaptive Card as follows:

* `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean` types are converted to a TextBlock.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>
  
  * **Source Schema**: `string`, `number`, `integer`, and `boolean`

       ```yml
        name:
          type: string
          example: doggie
       ```

  * **Target Schema**: `Textblock`

      ```json
      {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "name: ${if(name, name, 'N/A')}",
      "wrap": true
    }
      ```

  </details>

* `array`: An array is converted to a container inside Adaptive Card.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>

  * **Source schema**: `array`

    ```yml
        type: array
                  items:
                  required:
                    - name
                  type: object
                    properties:
                    id:
                      type: integer
                    category:
                      type: object
                      properties:
                      name:
                        type: string
    ```

  * **Target Schema**: `Container`

    ```json
        {
                  "type": "Container",
                  "$data": "${$root}",
                  "items": [
                    {
                      "type": "TextBlock",
                      "text": "id: ${if(id, id, 'N/A')}",
                      "wrap": true
                    },
                    {
                      "type": "TextBlock",
                      "text": "category.name: ${if(category.name, category.name, 'N/A')}",
                      "wrap": true
                    }
                  ]
                }
                
    ```

  </details>

* `object`: An object is converted to a nested property in Adaptive Card.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>

  * **Source Schema**: `object`

    ```yml
    components:
      schemas:
        Pet:
            category:
              type: object
            properties:
              id:
                type: integer
              name:
                type: string

    ```

  * **Target Schema**: Nested property in an Adaptive Card

    ```json
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "category.id: ${if(category.id, category.id, 'N/A')}",
      "wrap": true
    },
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "category.name: ${if(category.name, category.name, 'N/A')}",
      "wrap": true
    }

    ```

  </details>

* `image`: If a property is an image URL, then it converts to an Image element in the Adaptive Card.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>

  * **Source schema**: `image`

    ```yml
        image:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: The URL of the image of the item to be repaired

    ```

  * **Target Schema**: `"Image"`

    ```json
    {
          "type": "Image",
          "url": "${image}",
          "$when": "${image != null}"
        }

    ```

  </details>

</details>

## Authentication

You can implement authentication in API-based message extensions to provide secure and seamless access to applications. If your message extension requires authentication, add the `authorization` property under `composeExtensions` in app manifest and define the type of authentication for your application by setting the `authType` property under `authorization`. To enable authentication for your message extension, update your app manifest with any of the following authentication methods:

You can update `none` as a value for `authorization` in an API-based message extension when the API doesn't require any authentication for the user. When Teams service sends a request to the API, it doesn't supply any authentication information.

```json
    "authorization": {
      "authType": "none"
      }
    },
```

<details><summary id="secret-service-auth">Secret service auth</summary>


API secret service authentication is a method that allows your app to authenticate with your API. You can configure your endpoint to accept a secret to authenticate requests. The API secret must be registered in Microsoft Teams and when a user interacts with your message extension, Teams uses the secret to authenticate with your API. The following API key registration properties help you to secure your key and ensure it's limited to your application:

* **Base URL**: Teams transmits the secrets to endpoints where the URL begins with the value in this field.
* **Target Tenant**: To limit API access to your Microsoft 365 tenant.
* **App ID**: To limit the key access to a specific app.
* **Secret key**: To authorize access between your app and OpenAPI endpoints.


API secret service authentication is a secure method for your app to authenticate with API. You can [register an API key](#register-an-api-key) through the Developer Portal for Teams, and generate an API key registration ID. [Update the app manifest](#update-app-manifest) with the `apiSecretServiceAuthConfiguration` object with an `apiSecretRegistrationId` property. This property should contain the reference ID returned when you submitted the API key through the portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The API secret registration ID is not a secret itself and can be retrieved from the Teams App manifest. For more information on securing your secret, see best practices.

When an API request is initiated, the system retrieves the encrypted API key before storage and is stored in a secured location and includes it in the authorization header using the bearer token scheme and sends it to the endpoint defined in the app manifest. The user should verify the validity of the API key.

**Example**

```
GET https://example.com/search?myQuery=test
Accept-Language: en-US
Authorization: Bearer <MY_API_KEY>
```


### Register an API key

To register an API Key, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Tools** > **API key registration**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-me-api-key-registration.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the API key registration option in Developer Portal for Teams.":::

1. Select **+ New API key**.

1. In the **API key registration** page, under **Register an API key**, update the following:

   1. **Description**: Description of the API Key.
   1. **Add domain**: You must specify a path that initiates all the API endpoints. The path must start with https, include a fully qualified domain name, and optionally, a path. Teams only transmits the secrets to endpoints where the URL begins with this value. For example, `https://api.yelp.com`. *[Mandatory]*
   
      This ensures that the  key remains secure and isn't leaked to random endpoints, even if another app illicitly acquires the API secret registration ID and incorporates it into their own app. We enforce this URL constraint on API keys. If the path registered here doesn't prefix the target endpoint defined in the app manifest, the call gets dropped.

      :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-me-register-key-domain.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Description and Add domain options in the API key registration page in Developer Portal for Teams.":::

1. Under **Set a target tenant**, select any of the following:

   * **Home tenant**: The API key is only functional within the tenant where it's registered.
   * **Any tenant**: The API key t is usable in any tenant.


   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-me-api-key-tenant.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Home tenant and Any tenant options under set a target tenant heading in Developer Portal for Teams.":::

1. Under **Set a Teams app**, select any of the following:

   * **Any Teams app**: The API key can be used with any Teams app.
   * **Existing Teams app ID**: The **Existing Teams app** option binds the API secret registration to your specific Teams app. 

   Adding a domain ensures that the key isn't exposed to endpoints. However, the API secret registration ID is publicly accessible and can be added to random apps, potentially sending unwanted data to a developer's endpoint. To prevent this, you can bind the registration to a specific app and Teams rejects requests for any app other than the one specified in the secret registration.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-me-api-key-teams-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Any Teams app and Existing Teams app options under Set a Teams app heading in Developer Portal for Teams.":::

1. Select **+ Add Secret**. A **Add an API key** dialog appears.

1. Enter a value for the secret and select **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > * You can maintain up to two secrets for each API key registration. If one key is compromised, it can be promptly removed and allows Teams to switch to the second key.
   > * The secret value must have at least 10 characters and at most 128 characters.
   > * If the first key results in a 401 error, Teams automatically attempts to use the second key. It helps with uninterrupted service for users and eliminates any potential downtime during the creation of a new secret.

   An **API key registration ID** is generated.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-me-api-key-reg-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the API key registration ID generated in Developer Portal for Teams.":::

1. In Developer portal for Teams, select **Apps** and select an app where you want to add the API key.

1. Go to **App features** > **Message extension**.

1. Under **Authentication**, select **API key** and add the API key registration ID.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-me-auth-add-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of the Authentication section with none and API key options in Developer Portal for Teams.":::

The API key registration ID is update as the value for the `apiSecretRegistrationId` property in the app manifest.

### Update app manifest

You can authorize incoming requests to your service by configuring a static API key. The API key is stored securely and added to the API call. Add an `apiSecretServiceAuthConfiguration` object with an `apiSecretRegistrationId` property, which contains the reference ID when you submit the API key through the Developer portal for Teams.

<details><summary id="microsoft-entra">Microsoft Entra </summary>

`microsoftEntra` authentication method uses an app user's Teams identity to provide them with access to your app. A user who has signed into Teams doesn't need to sign in again to your app within the Teams environment. Microsoft Entra SSO enables the app to silently obtain a user token that is issued for its resource by Microsoft Entra. The app can then authenticate this token and retrieve the user profile information without the user's consent.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

* An Azure account with an active subscription.
* Basic familiarity with Microsoft Entra ID and Teams app development.

The following image shows how SSO works when a Teams app user attempts to access API-bsed message extension app:

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-me-entra-sso.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how Microsoft Entra SSO authorization works to authentication API." lightbox="../assets/images/Copilot/api-me-entra-sso.png" :::

* The user invokes the API-based message extension app from a message extension in Teams and requests a command that requires authentication.
* The app sends a request to the Teams backend service with the app ID and the required scope (access_as_user).
* The Teams backend service checks if the user consented to the app and the scope. If not, it shows a consent screen to the user and asks for permission.
* If the user consents, Microsoft Entra generates an access token for the user and the app, and sends it to the app in the authorization header of the request.
* The app validates the token. The user can extract the user information from the token, such as the name, email, and object ID.
* The app returns the response to the user in Teams.

To enable `microsoftEntra` authentication method for API-based message extension, follow these steps:

### Register a new app in Microsoft Entra ID

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.

2. Select the **App registrations** icon.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/azure-portal.png" alt-text="Microsoft Entra admin center page.":::

   The **App registrations** page appears.

3. Select **+ New registration** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/app-registrations.png" alt-text="New registration page on Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

    The **Register an application** page appears.

4. Enter the name of your app that you want to be displayed to the app user. You can change the name at a later stage if you want to.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/register-app.png" alt-text="App registration page on Microsoft Entra admin center.":::

5. Select the type of user account that can access your app. You can select from single or multitenant options in organizational directories, or restrict the access to personal Microsoft accounts only.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Options for supported account types</b></summary>

    | Option | Select this to... |
    | --- | --- |
    | Accounts in this organizational directory only (Microsoft only - Single tenant) | Build an application for use only by users (or guests) in your tenant. <br> Often called custom app built for your org (LOB app), this app is a single-tenant application in the Microsoft identity platform. |
    | Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) | Let users in any Microsoft Entra tenant use your application. This option is appropriate if, for example, you're building a SaaS application, and you intend to make it available to multiple organizations. <br> This type of app is known as a multitenant application in the Microsoft identity platform.|
    | Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Skype, Xbox) | Target the widest set of customers. <br> By selecting this option, you're registering a multitenant application that can support app users who have personal Microsoft accounts also. |
    | Personal Microsoft accounts only | Build an application only for users who have personal Microsoft accounts. |

    </details>

    > [!NOTE]
    > You don't need to enter **Redirect URI** for enabling SSO for an API-based message extension app.

7. Select **Register**.
    A message pops up on the browser stating that the app was created.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-me-entra-sso-register.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of the notification after the app registration is successful on Azure portal.":::

    The page with app ID and other configurations is displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-me-entra-sso-app-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the app details page in Azure portal.":::

8. Note and save the app ID from **Application (client) ID** to update the app manifest later.

    Your app is registered in Microsoft Entra ID. You now have the app ID for your API-based message extension app.

### Configure scope for access token

After you've created a new app registration, configure scope (permission) options for sending access token to Teams client, and authorizing trusted client applications to enable SSO.

To configure scope and authorize trusted client applications, you need:

* [Add Application ID URI](#application-id-uri): Configure scope (permission) options for your app. Expose a web API and configure the application ID URI.
* [Configure API scope](#configure-api-scope): Define scope for the API, and the users who can consent for a scope. You can only let admins provide consent for higher-privileged permissions.
* [Configure authorized client application](#configure-authorized-client-application): Create authorized client IDs for applications that you want to preauthorize. It allows the app user to access the app scopes (permissions) you've configured, without requiring any further consent. Preauthorize only those client applications you trust as your app users don't have the opportunity to decline consent.

#### Application ID URI

1. Select **Manage** > **Expose an API** from the left pane.

    The **Expose an API** page appears.

1. Select **Add** to generate application ID URI in the form of `api://{AppID}`.

You've successfully configured app scope, permissions, and client applications. Ensure that you note and save the application ID URI. Next, you configure the access token version.

### Update app manifest

Update the following properties in the app manifest file:

* `webApplicationInfo`: The `webApplicationInfo` property is used to enable SSO for your app to help app users access your API-based message extension app seamlessly. The application ID URI that you registered in Microsoft Entra ID is configured with the scope of the API you exposed. For more information, see [webApplicationInfo](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#webapplicationinfo).

   &nbsp;&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/sso-manifest.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the app manifest configuration.":::

* `microsoftEntraConfiguration`: Enables Single sign-on authentication for your app. Configure the `supportsSingleSignOn` property to `true` to support SSO and reduce the need for multiple authentications. If the property is set to `false` or is left empty, the user can't upload the app to Teams and the app fails validation.

To configure app manifest:

1. Open the API-based message extension app project.
2. Open the app manifest folder.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > * The app manifest folder should be at the root of your project. For more information, see [Create a Microsoft Teams app package](../concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
    > * For more information on learning how to create a manifest.json, see [the app manifest schema](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

1. Open the `manifest.json` file
1. Add the following code snippet to the app manifest file:

   **webApplicationInfo**

    ```json
    "webApplicationInfo":
    {
    "id": "{Microsoft Entra AppId}",
    "resource": "api://subdomain.example.com/{Microsoft Entra AppId}"
    }
    ```

    where,
    * `{Microsoft Entra AppId}` is the app ID you created when you registered your app in Microsoft Entra ID. It's the GUID.
    * `api://subdomain.example.com/{Microsoft Entra AppId}` is the application ID URI that you registered when creating scope in Microsoft Entra ID.

    **MicrosoftEntraConfiguration**

    ```json
    "authorization": {
      "authType": "microsoftEntra",
      “microsoftEntraConfiguration”: {
        “supportsSingleSignOn”: true
      }
    },
    ```
  
1. Save the app manifest file.

For more information, see [composeExtensions.commands](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#composeextensionscommands).

#### Authenticate token

When the message extension calls the API during authentication, it receives a request with the user’s access token. The message extension then adds the token in the authorization header of the outgoing HTTP request. The header format is `Authorization: Bearer <token_value>`. For example, when a message extension makes an API call to a service that requires authentication. The extension constructs an HTTP request as follows:

```http
GET /api/resource HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

After the API-based message extension gets a request header with token, perform the following steps:

* **Authenticate**: Verify the token for the audience, scope, issuer, and signature claims to check if the token is for your app.

  The following is an example of a JSON Web Token (JWT) with a header and response:

### Troubleshooting

* If you get a **Manifest parsing has failed** error message when uploading the app to teams, use [Teams app validator](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/validation) to validate the app package, including the app manifest and OpenAPI spec file. Review the [app manifest](#app-manifest) and the [OpenAPI Description document](#oad) requirements to resolve errors or warnings and try uploading your app.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-me-troubleshoot-sideload.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the error message when uploading an app to Teams along with the option to copy the error details to clipboard.":::

* If you encounter any issues while running your app in Teams, use the following troubleshooting steps to identify and resolve your issue:

  * **Network**: Select the **Network** tab in Developer tools to inspect network activity

     1. Open [Teams web client](https://teams.microsoft.com).
     1. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 credentials.
     1. Go to a chat, and run your message extension app.
     1. At the top-right, select **Settings and more (...)**. Go to **More tools** > **Developer tools**.
     1. Select **Network**. Select the **filter** option and enter **invoke** in the search field.
     1. Select an error from the list.
     1. In the right pane, select the **Response** tab.

     1. A JSON object representing an error response from a service or API is displayed. It contains a `standardizedError` object with `errorCode`, `errorSubCode`, and `errorDescription`, which have more details about the error.

        :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-me-troubleshoot-network.png" alt-text="Screenshots shows the network tab, the list of Invoke Errors, and the error details in the response tab in Developer tools while running a message extension in Teams and getting an error.":::

      **Common HTTP Error Responses**:

    * A 400 Bad Request error might occur if a request parameter is missing or incorrectly formatted.
    * A 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden error suggests issues with the API key, such as it being missing or unauthorized.

# Extend bot-based message extension as plugin for Copilot for Microsoft 365

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Ensure that Copilot for Microsoft 365 is available for your organization. You have two ways to get a developer environment for Copilot:
>   * A sandbox Microsoft 365 tenant with Copilot (available in limited preview through [TAP membership](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/tap)).
>   * An [eligible Microsoft 365 or Office 365 production environment](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#customers-with-existing-microsoft-365-and-copilot-licenses) with a Copilot for Microsoft 365 license.
> * Bot-based search message extension plugin is available in [**public developer preview**](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).
> * Only *bot-based* message extensions with *search* commands can be extended as plugins for Copilot for Microsoft 365.

Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, powered by an advanced processing and orchestration engine, integrates Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft Graph, and large language models (LLMs) to transform your words into a potent productivity tool. Although Copilot for Microsoft 365 can utilize apps and data within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, many users rely on various external tools and services for work management and collaboration. By extending your message extension as a plugin in Copilot for Microsoft 365, you can enable users to interact with third-party tools and services, therefore empowering them to achieve more with Copilot for Microsoft 365. You can achieve this extension by developing a plugin or connecting to an external data source.

## What is a plugin?

A plugin allows Copilot for Microsoft 365 to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhance its capabilities, and broaden its range of capabilities. Plugins allow Copilot for Microsoft 365 to:

* Fetch real-time information, such as the latest news coverage on a product launch.
* Retrieve knowledge-based information, such as a team’s design files in Figma.
* Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as creating a Contoso ticket.

Descriptions enhance the usability and effectiveness of a message extension plugin. The follwoing description offer a clear and concise summary of the app’s features:

* **App description**: App description helps improve your app discoverability in the Teams Store.
* **Command description**: Command description maps user intent and utterance to search command inside a plugin and must be built based on the analysis of the user intent and keywords.
* **Parameter description**: Parameter description explains the requirements of the system in a natural language with output format.
* **Semantic description**: Semantic description helps Copilot for Micrososft 365 generate content by providing a conceptual understanding of the plugin's capabilities and scenarios where it can help achieve user goals and match user’s intent with the plugin's capabilities.

For more information, see [define descriptions](high-quality-message-extension.md#define-descriptions).

All bot-based search message extensions are eligible for plugin support, subject to validation to ensure the plugin meets quality, security, privacy, and usefulness expectations. You can create a bot-based search message extension using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Teams Toolkit command line interface (CLI), or Developer Portal for Teams and extend the message extension to function as a plugin in Copilot for Microsoft 365.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you're familiar with the following standards and guidelines for building message extension plugins for Copilot for Microsoft 365:

* Standards for compliance, performance, security, and user experience outlined in [Teams Store validation guidelines](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines.md#teams-apps-extensible-as-plugin-for-microsoft-copilot-for-microsoft-365).

* [Guidelines to create or upgrade a message extension plugin for Copilot for Microsoft 365](../messaging-extensions/high-quality-message-extension.md).

## Create bot-based message extension

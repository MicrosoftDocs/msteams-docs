# Extend bot-based message extension as agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Ensure that Microsoft 365 Copilot is available for your organization. You have two ways to get a developer environment for Microsoft 365 Copilot:
>   * A sandbox Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft 365 Copilot (available in limited preview through [TAP membership](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/tap)).
>   * An [eligible Microsoft 365 or Office 365 production environment](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#customers-with-existing-microsoft-365-and-copilot-licenses) with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.
> * Bot-based search message extension agent is available in [**public developer preview**](../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).
> * Only *bot-based* message extensions with *search* commands can be extended as agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot.

Microsoft 365 Copilot, powered by an advanced processing and orchestration engine, integrates Microsoft 365 apps, Microsoft Graph, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform your words into a potent productivity tool. Although Microsoft 365 Copilot can utilize apps and data within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, many users rely on various external tools and services for work management and collaboration. By extending your message extension as an agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can enable users to interact with third-party tools and services, therefore empowering them to achieve more with Microsoft 365 Copilot. You can achieve this extension by developing an agent or connecting to an external data source.

## What is an agent?

An agent allows Microsoft 365 Copilot to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhance its capabilities, and broaden its range of capabilities. Agents allow Microsoft 365 Copilot to:

* Fetch real-time information, such as the latest news coverage on a product launch.
* Retrieve knowledge-based information, such as a team’s design files in Figma.

Descriptions enhance the usability and effectiveness of a message extension agent. The following description offer a clear and concise summary of the app’s features:

* **App description**: App description helps improve your app discoverability in the Teams Store.
* **Command description**: Command description maps user intent and utterance to search command inside an agent and must be built based on the analysis of the user intent and keywords.
* **Parameter description**: Parameter description explains the requirements of the system in a natural language with output format.
* **Semantic description**: Semantic description helps Microsoft 365 Copilot generate content by providing a conceptual understanding of the agent's capabilities and scenarios where it can help achieve user goals and match user’s intent with the agent's capabilities.

For more information, see [guidelines to create and upgrade agents](dev-guidelines-agents.md).

All bot-based search message extensions that are eligible for agent support must meet [policy requirement](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/review-copilot-validation-guidelines.md) and are subject to validation to ensure the agent meets quality, security, privacy, and usefulness expectations. You can create a bot-based search message extension using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Teams Toolkit command line interface (CLI), or Developer Portal for Teams and extend the message extension to function as an agent in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you're familiar with the following standards and guidelines for building message extension agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot:

* Standards for compliance, performance, security, and user experience outlined in [Teams Store validation guidelines](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines.md#teams-apps-extensible-as-agents-for-microsoft-365-copilot).

* [Guidelines to create or upgrade a message extension agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot](dev-guidelines-agents.md).

## Create bot-based message extension

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot are in preview and work only in Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams.

Let's create a bot-based search message extension agent for Teams and Microsoft 365 Copilot and share results through the compose message area of the Microsoft Teams client.

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

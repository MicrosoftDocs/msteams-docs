# Guidelines to create and upgrade Copilot agents

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot are in preview and work only in Microsoft 365 Copilot.
> * Message extension plugins are in preview.
> * Message extensions plugins in Microsoft 365 Copilot are in public preview for Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint.
> * Ensure that Microsoft 365 Copilot is available for your organization. You have two ways to get a developer environment for Microsoft 365 Copilot:
>   * A sandbox Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft 365 Copilot (available in limited preview through [TAP membership](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/tap)).
>   * An enterprise customer production environment with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses.
> For more information about validation guidelines for Copilot agents to increase their chance for being listed on the Team Store, see [validation guidelines for Copilot agents](../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/review-copilot-validation-guidelines.md).

Microsoft 365 plugins provide integration with various  Microsoft 365 products, such as Teams and Outlook. The integration helps users to search or create content in external systems. Message extension plugins allow Microsoft 365 Copilot to interact with APIs from other software and services through a bot. With Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can:

* Search for the latest information or record. For example, the latest incident ticket or survey results.
* Summarize information based on multiple records. For example, summarize all incident tickets related to the project Northwind.

We recommend that you build or upgrade your existing message extensions to maximize their usefulness and usability in Microsoft 365 Copilot. Message extensions must support one or more search commands. As Microsoft 365 Copilot recognizes them as skills, it can execute on behalf of the user.

## Define app, command, and parameter descriptions

[*Must fix*]

A good description offers a clear and concise summary of the app’s features and allows Microsoft 365 Copilot to efficiently discover and execute search operations. When a user enters the app name along with a verb, for example, **Find Contoso tickets**, the message extension plugin must be invoked from Microsoft 365 Copilot.

### App description

Long and short app descriptions must be clear and define the app's scope. To render an app as a plugin in Microsoft 365 Copilot, modify the app description to suit the following plugin requirements:

* Long description must clearly explain the functionality and usage of the message extension plugin in Microsoft 365 Copilot. For example, use Contoso cloud in Microsoft 365 Copilot to search and summarize your tasks.
* Short description must briefly describe the app's functionality in a natural language and can include the name of the app.

The following code snippets show the short description examples for each category:

# [Tasks](#tab/tasks)

**Description**: Create, search, view tickets, bugs, and projects.

**App description example:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.13/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "1.13",
  "id": "2bxxxxc5-5xxx-4xxx-aXXX-94xxxx8919e5",
  "name": {
    "short": "Tasks",
    "full": "Contoso Tasks"
  },
  "description": {
    "short": "Create, search, view tickets, bugs, and projects",
    "full": "Contoso Tasks makes it easy to stay organized. Create, assign, and track tasks individually or collaboratively with your team, and see everything come together in one place."
  },
```

# [Surveys](#tab/surveys)

**Description**: Create and search for surveys and results.

**App description example:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.13/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "1.13",
  "id": "2bxxxxc5-5xxx-4xxx-aXXX-94xxxx8919e5",
  "name": {
    "short": "Survey",
    "full": "Contoso Survey"
  },
  "description": {
    "short": "Create and search for surveys and results.",
    "full": "Contoso Survey helps you manage all your surveys in one place. Create, capture, and analyze surveys within the platform you use every day."
  },
```

# [CRM](#tab/crm)

**Description**: Search and view customer leads.

**App description example:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.13/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "1.13",
  "id": "2bxxxxc5-5xxx-4xxx-aXXX-94xxxx8919e5",
  "name": {
    "short": "CRM",
    "full": "Contoso CRM"
  },
  "description": {
    "short": "Search and view customer leads.",
    "full": "Resolve tickets faster, simplify employee workflows and improve team performance by integrating Contoso CRM to Microsoft Teams. Contoso CRM is a complete customer service solution that’s easy to use and scales with your business."
  }
```

# [General](#tab/general)

**Description**:  Stock and share lookup tool.

**App description example:**

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.13/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "manifestVersion": "1.13",
  "id": "2bxxxxc5-5xxx-4xxx-aXXX-94xxxx8919e5",
  "name": {
    "short": "General",
    "full": "Contoso stocks"
  },
  "description": {
    "short": "Stock and share look up tool.",
    "full": "Get real-time stock quotes and share them in a conversation. Search by company name, share, or stocks."
```

---

### Search command description

Command description maps user intent and utterance to search command inside a plugin and must be built based on the analysis of the user intent and keywords. Search command descriptions must:

* Focus on what and how the command searches (detailed list) in natural language.
* Include verbs and synonyms, if applicable.
* Focus on keywords that are likely to be used in the search function of your native apps.

#### Semantic description

[*Good-to-fix*]

The [semanticDescription](../resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md#composeextensionscommands) property is used to provide a detailed description of a command for Microsoft 365 Copilot. Semantic description for commands supports up to 5,000 characters and isn't displayed in the user interface. If the `semanticDescription` property is left empty, Microsoft 365 Copilot uses the information in the `description` field. When writing a `semanticDescription`, you must include information about expected values, limits, and ranges for the command.

The `semanticDescription` property isn't a mandatory field. However, if you add `semanticDescription` in app manifest, the existing validation checks for short, parameter, and command descriptions are also applicable for semantic descriptions.

The following code snippets show the command and semantic description examples for each category:

# [Tasks](#tab/tasks)

**Description**: Search for high priority tasks related to Northwind that are due tomorrow.

**Command description example:**

```json

          "description": "Search for high priority tasks related to Northwind that are due tomorrow.",
          "SemanticDescription": "Search for issues, epics, stories, tasks, sub tasks, bugs + additional details."
          "initialRun": true,
          "fetchTask": false,
          "context": [
            "commandBox",
            "compose",
            "message"
          ],
```

          "title": "Survey",
          "description": "Search for surveys, drafts, and results with keywords or number of respondents.",
          "semanticDescription": "This command enables users to search for surveys, drafts, and results based on specific keywords or the number of respondents."
          "initialRun": true,
          "fetchTask": false,
          "context": [
            "commandBox",

          "description": "Through CRM plugin, find qualified, unqualified, and quoted leads of clients and customers.",
          "semanticDescription": "This command allows users to search for leads in the CRM system based on specific criteria.",
          "initialRun": true,
          "fetchTask": false,
          "context": [
            "commandBox",

          "context": [
            "commandBox",
            "compose",
            "message"
          ],
```

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For activating the OAuth sign-in link in the plugin, ensure that you set the `initialRun` property to `true` for search commands within the app manifest.

### Parameter description

Each message extension command supports has a corresponding `parameters' property, which supports up to five parameters and the first parameter must be visible in the message extension search bar. A parameter must have a good description, which must contain a combination of acceptable parameters, enums, acronyms, and output format.

The [semanticDescription](../resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md#composeextensionscommands) property is used to provide a detailed description of a command for Microsoft 365 Copilot. Semantic description for parameters supports up to 2,000 characters and isn't displayed in the user interface. If the `semanticDescription` property is left empty, Microsoft 365 Copilot uses the information in the `description` field. When writing a `semanticDescription`, you must include information about expected values, limits, and ranges for the command.

A good parameter description explains the requirements of the system in a natural language with output format. The following are a few examples of basic and advanced search requests for each category:

# [Tasks](#tab/tasks)

Basic search: Search for tasks related to Northwind.</br>
Advanced search: Search for high priority tasks related to Northwind that are due tomorrow.

## Enhance message extension to retrieve information through compound utterances

[*Must fix*]

> [!NOTE]
> Search through dialog (referred as task module in TeamsJS v1.x) isn't supported in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

For Microsoft 365 Copilot, a search-based message extension must support more than three unique compound utterances to perform deep retrieval of accurate information. To enable compound utterances, you must expand the scope of search to handle three or more parameters by updating the [app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest)](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#composeextensionscommands) and ensure the following:

* Update your web service to support search based on multiple parameters. For more information on how to respond to user requests, see [Respond to search command](how-to/search-commands/respond-to-search.md).
* Microsoft 365 Copilot might pass an empty string or null value for parameters, which aren't part of user utterance, update your web service to handle the parameters.

* A message extension supports upto 10 commands (9 usable) and each command has a corresponding `parameters` property, which supports up to five parameters.

The search parameters must have good descriptions with acceptable parameters, enums, acronyms, and output format. For more information and examples, see [Parameter description](#parameter-description).

## Define sample prompts

[*Must fix*]

The [`samplePrompts`](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#composeextensionscommands) property guides users on how to use the various plugins within Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft 365 Copilot uses the sample prompts to display the prompts for the user. The prompts must be adaptable to different locales and clear across different commands. Sample prompts are available for First Run Experience (FRE) within Microsoft 365 Copilot when a user first installs or enables a plugin.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/bot-based-sample-prompts.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the sample prompts displayed when the message extension plugin is enabled in Microsoft 365 Copilot.":::

> [!NOTE]
>
> * If the app manifest doesn't specify the `samplePrompts` property, the prompts aren't displayed.
> * The `samplePrompts` property is mandatory for app validation during the app submission process.
> * If you define multiple commands for your app, a maximum of three prompts (one from each of the top three commands) are displayed to the user. The prompts rotate to provide the user with a diverse set of prompts across different commands.

The following code is an example of the `samplePrompts` property in app manifest:

```json
"composeExtensions": [
 {

## Create rich Adaptive Card responses

[*Must fix*]

Message extensions respond to a user input with an Adaptive Card. An Adaptive Card for a message extension plugin must function effectively, appear rich, and meet the following requirements:

* Adaptive Card response must include Adaptive Card content and preview card information as part of the same template. [*Must fix*]

  > [!NOTE]
  > Action types `imBack`, `messageBack` aren't supported in a data object.

  The following action types are recommended:

  * `Action.OpenUrl`: Opens a specified URL from the Card.
  * `Action.ToggleVisibility`: Displays or hides one or more elements in the card.
  * `Action.Execute`: Collects the input fields and sends them as a request to your bot service.
  * `Action.Submit`: Opens a dialog or Stageview using type invoke in data object.

* If a user can change any information on the card through dialog, Stageview, or directly from the card, we recommend the Adaptive Card to support universal actions and automatic refresh. [*Recommended*]
* Adaptive Cards must include a URL as part of the [metadata](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Metadata.html), which allows cards to be easily copied from one hub to another. [*Recommended*]
* Apart from thumbnails, any image in an Adaptive Card must have an alt-text. [*Recommended*]

## Message extension plugins in Microsoft 365 Copilot apps

[*Must fix*]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Message extension plugins in Microsoft 365 Copilot apps are in limited private preview for Word and PowerPoint. More details to be published after a public preview is announced.

Copilot agents customize and extend the Microsoft 365 Copilot experience by bringing more skills and knowledge to Microsoft 365 Copilot for a personalized user experience. By using plugins, which are a subset of Copilot agents, users can integrate additional capabilities into Microsoft 365 Copilot by interacting with third-party applications, whether for retrieving or modifying information within those apps. For instance, message extension plugins facilitate searching for data in other applications so that Microsoft 365 Copilot can present it upon request when the plugin is activated.

 If you've developed a plugin for Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams or [copilot.microsoft.com](https://copilot.microsoft.com/#/), you're already aware of the benefits it offers to users within their workflow.

# Create an API-based message extension

> [!NOTE]
> API-based message extensions only support search commands.

API-based message extensions are a Microsoft Teams app capability that integrates external APIs directly into Teams, enhancing your app's usability and offering a seamless user experience. API-based message extensions support search commands and can be used to fetch and display data from external services within Teams, streamlining workflows by reducing the need to switch between applications.

Before you get started, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

</br>
<details><summary id="oad">1. OpenAPI Description (OAD) </summary>

Ensure that you adhere to following guidelines for OpenAPI Description (OAD) document:

* OpenAPI versions 2.0 and 3.0.x are supported.
* JSON and YAML are the supported formats.
* The request body, if present, must be application/Json.
* Define an HTTPS protocol server URL for the `servers.url` property.
* Only POST and GET HTTP methods are supported.
* The OpenAPI Description document must have an `operationId`.
* Only one required parameter without a default value is allowed.
* A required parameter with a default value is considered optional.
* Users must not enter a parameter for a header or cookie.
* The operation must not have a required header or cookie parameters without default values.
* Ensure that there are no remote references in the OpenAPI Description document.
* Constructing arrays for the request isn’t supported; however, nested objects within a JSON request body are supported.
* Teams doesn't support the `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`, and `not` (swagger.io) constructs.

The following code is an example of an OpenAPI Description document:

```yml

<details><summary id="app-manifest">2. App manifest</summary>

Ensure that you adhere to following guidelines for app manifest:

* Set the app manifest version to `1.17`.
* Set `composeExtensions.composeExtensionType` to `apiBased`.
* Define `composeExtensions.apiSpecificationFile` as the relative path to the OpenAPI Description file within the folder. This links the app manifest to the API specification.
* Define `apiResponseRenderingTemplateFile` as the relative path to the response rendering template. This specifies the location of the template used for rendering API responses.
* Each command must have a link to the response rendering template. This connects each command to its corresponding response format.
* The `Commands.id` property in the app manifest must match the `operationId` in the OpenAPI Description.
* If a required parameter is without a default value, the command `parameters.name` in the app manifest must match the `parameters.name` in the OpenAPI Description document.
* If there’s no required parameter, the command `parameters.name` in the app manifest must match the optional `parameters.name` in the OpenAPI Description.
* Make sure that the parameters for each command match exactly with the names of the parameters defined for the operation in the OpenAPI spec.
* A [response rendering template](#response-template) must be defined per command, which is used to convert responses from an API.
* Full description must not exceed 128 characters.

<details><summary id="response-template">3. Response rendering template</summary>

> [!NOTE]
>
> Teams supports Adaptive Cards up to version 1.5 and the Adaptive Cards Designer supports up to version 1.6.

* **Define the schema reference URL** in the `$schema` property to establish the structure of your template.
* **The supported values for `responseLayout`** are `list` and `grid`, which determine how the response is visually presented.
* **A `jsonPath` is recommended** for arrays or when the data for the Adaptive Card isn't the root object. For example, if your data is nested under `productDetails`, your JSON path would be `productDetails`.
* **Define `jsonPath` as the path** to the relevant data or array in the API response. If the path points to an array, then each entry in the array binds with the Adaptive Card template and returns as a separate result. *[Optional]*
* **Get a sample response** for validating the response rendering template. This serves as a test to ensure your template works as expected.
* **Use tools such as Fiddler or Postman** to call the API and ensure that the request and the response are valid. This step is crucial for troubleshooting and confirming that your API is functioning correctly.
* **You can use the Adaptive Card Designer** to bind the API response to the response rendering template and preview the Adaptive Card. Insert the template in the **CARD PAYLOAD EDITOR** and insert the sample response entry in the **SAMPLE DATA EDITOR**.

In this case, searching for 'a' in the 'SME test app' returns five cards showing 'Title', 'Description' (truncated) and 'AssignedTo' properties and values in each one.":::

 **Expanded Adaptive Card**

  :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/Copilot/api-based-message-extension-expanded-adaptive-card.png" alt-text="Example of how the Adaptive Card looks like expanded once a user selects a preview card. The Adaptive Card shows the Title, the full Description, AssignedTo, RepairId, and Date values.":::

#### Parameters

|Property  |Type  |Description  |Required  |
|--------- |---------|---------|---------|
|`version` |  `string` | The schema version of the current response rendering template.        |  Yes       |
|`jsonPath`     | `string`        | The path to the relevant section in the results to which the responseCardTemplate and previewCardTemplate should be applied. If not set, the root object is treated as the relevant section. If the relevant section is an array, each entry is mapped to the responseCardTemplate and the previewCardTemplate.        |   No      |
|`responseLayout`    | `responseLayoutType`        |  Specifies the layout of the results in the message extension flyout. The supported types are `list` and `grid`.       |    Yes     |
|`responseCardTemplate`    |  `adaptiveCardTemplate`  | A template for creating an Adaptive Card from a result entry.      |   Yes      |
|`previewCardTemplate`     |  `previewCardTemplate`       | A template for creating a preview card from a result entry. The resulting preview card is displayed in the message extension flyout menu.        |  Yes       |

#### Json path

The JSON path is optional but should be used for arrays or where the object to be used as the data for the adaptive card isn't the root object. The JSON path should follow the format defined by Newtonsoft. If the JSON path points to an array, then each entry in that array is bound with the adaptive card template and returns as separate results.

**Example**
Let's say you have the below JSON for a list of products and you want to create a card result for each entry.

```json
{
   "version": "1.0",
   "title": "All Products",
   "warehouse": {
      "products": [
        ...
      ]
   }
}
```

As you can see, the array of results is under "products", which is nested under "warehouse", so the JSON path would be "warehouse.products".

Use <https://adaptivecards.io/designer/> to preview the adaptive card by inserting the template into Card Payload Editor, and take a sample response entry from your array or for your object and insert it into the Same Data editor on the right. Make sure that the card renders properly and is to your liking.
Note that Teams supports cards up to version 1.5 while the designer supports 1.6.

#### Schema mapping

The properties in OpenAPI Description document are mapped to the Adaptive Card template as follows:

* `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean` types are converted to a TextBlock.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>
  
  * **Source Schema**: `string`, `number`, `integer`, and `boolean`

       ```yml
        name:
          type: string
          example: doggie
       ```

  * **Target Schema**: `Textblock`

      ```json
      {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "name: ${if(name, name, 'N/A')}",
      "wrap": true
    }
      ```

  </details>

* `array`: An array is converted to a container inside Adaptive Card.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>

                      properties:
                      name:
                        type: string
    ```

  * **Target Schema**: `Container`

    ```json
        {
                  "type": "Container",
                  "$data": "${$root}",
                  "items": [

                      "text": "category.name: ${if(category.name, category.name, 'N/A')}",
                      "wrap": true
                    }
                  ]
                }
                
    ```

  </details>

* `object`: An object is converted to a nested property in Adaptive Card.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>

  * **Source Schema**: `object`

    ```yml
    components:
      schemas:
        Pet:
            category:
              type: object
            properties:
              id:
                type: integer
              name:
                type: string

    ```

  * **Target Schema**: Nested property in an Adaptive Card

    ```json
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "category.id: ${if(category.id, category.id, 'N/A')}",
      "wrap": true
    },
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "category.name: ${if(category.name, category.name, 'N/A')}",
      "wrap": true
    }

    ```

  </details>

* `image`: If a property is an image URL, then it converts to an Image element in the Adaptive Card.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>

  * **Source schema**: `image`

    ```yml
        image:
          type: string
          format: uri
          description: The URL of the image of the item to be repaired

    ```

  * **Target Schema**: `"Image"`

    ```json
    {
          "type": "Image",
          "url": "${image}",
          "$when": "${image != null}"
        }

    ```

      | File | Contents |
      | --- | --- |
      | `src/functions/repair.ts` | The main file of a function in Azure Functions. Defines an Azure Function that retrieves and filters repair records based on a query parameter from an HTTP GET request, and returns the results as a JSON response. |
      | `src/repairsData.json` | The data source for the repair API. |
      | `src/keyGen.ts` | Designed to generate an API key used for authorization. |
      | `appPackage/apiSpecificationFile/repair.yml` | A file that describes the structure and behavior of the repair API. |
      | `appPackage/responseTemplates/repair.json` | A template file for rendering API response. |
      | `teamsapp.yml` | The main Teams Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions.|
      |`teamsapp.local.yml` | Overrides teamsapp.yml with actions that enable local execution and debugging.|
      |`aad.manifest.json` | Defines the configuration of Microsoft Entra app. This template only provisions a single tenant Microsoft Entra app.|

           ```
           npm run keygen
           ```

           The API key is generated as **Generated a new API Key: xxx...**. The generated API key is registered and recorded in the [API key registration tool](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/api-key-registration) in Developer portal for Teams. For more information on API key registration, see [Register an API key](api-based-secret-service-auth.md#register-an-api-key).

        4. Enter the generated API key into your `env/.env.*.user` file. Replace `<your-api-key>` with the actual key:

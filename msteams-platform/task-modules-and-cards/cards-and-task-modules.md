# Cards and task modules

Cards provide your users with a variety of visual, audio, and selectable messages and assist in conversation flow.

With task modules, you can create modal pop-up experiences in Microsoft Teams. They are particularly useful for starting and completing tasks or displaying rich information like videos or Power business intelligence (BI) dashboards.

You can format card text using a subset of XML or HTML formatting or Markdown, depending on the card type. You can add and respond to card actions that open a URL, send messages and payload to the bot, or initiate OAuth flow. Adaptive Card, hero card, list card, Office 365 connector card, receipt card, signin card, thumbnail card, and card collections listed in cards reference are supported in bots for Teams.

Task modules can be invoked in channel or personal tabs, bots, or deep links. Your user's experience for any workflows that required data input can be improved by adding a task module to your tab. Task modules can be invoked from Teams bots using buttons on Adaptive Cards and Bot Framework cards.

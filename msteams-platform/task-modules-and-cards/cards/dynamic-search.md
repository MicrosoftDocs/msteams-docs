# Typeahead search in Adaptive Cards

Typeahead search functionality in Adaptive Cards gives an enhanced search experience on `Input.ChoiceSet` component. It provides a list of choices to enter text in the search field. You can incorporate typeahead search with Adaptive Cards to search and select data.

You can use typeahead search for the following searches:

* [Static search](#static-typeahead-search)
* [Dynamic search](#dynamic-typeahead-search)

## Static typeahead search

Static typeahead search allows users to search from values specified within `Input.ChoiceSet` in the Adaptive Card payload. Static typeahead search can be used to show multiple choices to the user. The payload size in static search increases with number of choices specified in the payload.
As user starts entering the texts, the choices are filtered, which partially match the input. The dropdown list highlights the input characters that match the search.

The following image demonstrates static typeahead search:

## Dynamic typeahead search

Dynamic typeahead search is useful to search and select data from large data sets. The data sets are loaded dynamically from the dataset specified in the card payload. The typeahead functionality helps to filter out the choices as the user types.

# [Mobile](#tab/mobile)

Android and iOS mobile clients support typeahead search in Adaptive Cards.

**Scenario**

John is a store employee who works at an Xbox retail store. The store uses a bot to take new purchase requests from customers. A customer can search from the thousands of games available. Typeahead search in Adaptive Cards is used to search and select customers' choices.

**To use typeahead search in Adaptive Cards**

1. User A opens the store bot.
1. User A sends a command to the bot for a **New customer request**. The bot responds with the Adaptive Card that has `Input.ChoiceSet` component.
1. User A uses typeahead search to search and select the information based on the customer's choice.

The following image illustrates mobile experience of typeahead search:

> [!NOTE]
> You can't get rich card experiences with dynamic search, such as query-based message extensions.

## Implement typeahead search

`Input.ChoiceSet` is one of the important input components in Adaptive Cards. You can add a typeahead search control to `Input.ChoiceSet` component to implement typeahead search. You can search and select the required information with the following selections:

* Dropdown, such as expanded selection.
* Radio button, such as single selection.
* Checkboxes, such as multiple selections.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The `Input.ChoiceSet` control is based on the style and `isMultiSelect` properties.
> * To use dynamic typeahead search in group chat, the user must add `groupchat` scope to the bot installation scope in the app manifest and install it to that particular group chat.
> * The number of options in the dropdown is limited to 15.

### Schema properties

The following properties are the new additions to the [`Input.ChoiceSet`](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Input.ChoiceSet.html) schema to enable typeahead search:

| Property| Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| style | Compact <br/> Expanded <br/> Filtered | No | Adds filtered style to the list of supported validations for static typeahead. |
| choices.data | Data.Query | No | Enables dynamic typeahead as the user types, by fetching a remote set of choices from a backend. |
| value | String | No | The initial choice (or set of choices) that must be selected. For multi-select, specify a comma-separated string of values. |

### Data.Query

| Property| Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| type | Data.Query | Yes | Specifies that it's a Data.Query object. |
| dataset | String | Yes | Specifies the type of data that is fetched dynamically. |
| value | String | No | Populates for the invoke request to the bot with the input that the user provided to the `ChoiceSet`. |
| count | Number | No | Populates for the invoke request to the bot to specify the number of elements that must be returned. The bot ignores it if the users want to send a different amount. |
| skip | Number | No | Populates for the invoke request to the bot to indicate that users want to paginate and move ahead in the list. |
| associatedInputs | String | No | Specifies the input values associated with the `Data.Query` object. Allowed values: `auto`, `none` |

When you define the `associatedInputs` property under the `Data.Query` object and set it to `auto`, Teams includes all input values of the card in the data query request sent to the bot. If you set the value to `none`, Teams doesn't include any input values in the data query request. This property allows the bot to use input values as search filters to refine dynamic typeahead search. For more information, see [dependent inputs](#dependent-inputs).

## Dependent inputs

> [!NOTE]
> Dependent inputs aren't available in [Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC High, and Department of Defense (DOD)](~/concepts/app-fundamentals-overview.md#government-community-cloud) environments.

You can design Adaptive Cards in Teams where the value of an input depends on the value of another. For example, consider an Adaptive Card with two `Input.ChoiceSet` dropdowns: one for selecting a country and another for selecting a specific city within that country. The first dropdown must filter the cities displayed in the second dropdown. This can be achieved by creating an `Input.ChoiceSet` dropdown with dynamic typeahead search that depends on one or more other inputs in the card.

### How it works

To create dependent inputs in an Adaptive Card, use the following properties:

1. **valueChangedAction**: Define this property on any input element, such as `Input.Text` or `Input.ChoiceSet`. This property allows you to define the `Action.ResetInputs` action, which triggers a data query request to the bot when a user changes the value of an input in the card.

1. **Action.ResetInputs**: This action resets the values of the inputs you specify under `targetInputIds` to their default values.

1. **associatedInputs**: Define this property under the [Data.Query](#dataquery) object. This property ensures that when Teams makes a data query request to your bot, it includes the values of all the inputs in the card.

### Action.ResetInputs

The `Action.ResetInputs` property resets the values of the inputs in an Adaptive Card. By default, the `Action.ResetInputs` property resets the values of all the inputs in an Adaptive Card. If you must reset particular input values, define the IDs of the elements containing those values in the `targetInputIds` property.

| Property| Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `valueChangedAction` | Action.ResetInputs | ✔️ | Contains the `Action.ResetInputs` property. |
| `Action.ResetInputs` | String | ✔️ | Resets the input values. |
| `targetInputIds` | Array of strings | | Defines the IDs of the input values to be reset. |
| `id` | String | | A unique identifier for the action. |
| `requires` | Object | | A list of capabilities the action requires the host application to support. If the host application doesn't support at least one of the listed capabilities, the action isn't rendered, and its fallback is rendered if provided. |
| `fallback` | Object or String | | Defines an alternate action to render. Set the value to `drop` to ignore the action if `Action.ResetInputs` is unsupported or if the host application doesn't support all the capabilities specified in the `requires` property. |
| `iconUrl` | String | | A URL to an image to be displayed on the left of the action's title. Data URIs are supported. |
| `isEnabled` | Boolean | | Defines the `enabled` or `disabled` state of the action. A user can't select a disabled action. If the action is represented as a button, the button's style reflects this state. |
| `mode` | String | | Defines if the action is primary or secondary. Allowed values: `primary`, `secondary` |
| `style` | String | | Defines the style of the action, affecting its visual and spoken representations. Allowed values: `default`, `positive`, or `destructive` |
| `title` | String | | The title of the action, as it appears on a button. |
| `tooltip` | String | | The tooltip text to display when a user hovers over the action. |

### Example

Consider the earlier example: a card with two `Input.ChoiceSet` dropdowns that allow users to select a country and a city within that country. The following card payload demonstrates how to use the `valueChangedAction` and `associatedInputs` properties to implement the card.

* The `valueChangedAction` property is defined alongside the `country` input to ensure that whenever its value changes, the value of the `city` input is reset.
* Since the `city` input is required, resetting its value forces the user to select a new city whenever the value of `country` changes.
* With the `associatedInputs` property defined, when Teams sends a data query request to the bot, it includes the value of the `country` input. Thus, when the user starts typing in the `city` input, the card returns a list of cities for the selected country.

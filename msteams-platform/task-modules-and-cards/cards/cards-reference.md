# Types of cards

Adaptive, hero, list, connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups, receipt, sign in, and thumbnail cards and card collections are supported in bots for Microsoft Teams. They're based on cards defined by the Bot Framework, but Teams doesn't support all Bot Framework cards and has added some of its own.

Before you identify the different card types, understand how to create a hero card, thumbnail card, or Adaptive Card.

## Create a hero card, thumbnail card, or Adaptive Card

To create a hero card, thumbnail card, or Adaptive Card from Developer Portal for Teams:

1. Go to [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home).
1. Select **Design and build Adaptive Cards**.
1. Select **New card**.
1. Enter card name and select **Save**.
1. Select one of the cards from **Hero Card**, **Thumbnail Card**, or **Adaptive Card**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/Cards/Herocarddetailsteams.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of the configuration options for a hero card in the Adaptive Card editor in the Developer Portal.":::

1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Send me this card**. The card is sent to you as a chat message.

## Card examples

You can find additional information on how to use cards in the documentation for the Bot Builder SDK v3. Code samples are also available in the **Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples** repository on GitHub. Following are a few card examples:

* .NET
  * [Add cards as attachments to messages](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-add-media-attachments?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp#send-an-adaptive-card&preserve-view=true).
  * [Cards sample code Bot Builder v4](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/main/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/06.using-cards).

* Node.js
  * [Add cards as attachments to messages](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-add-media-attachments?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=javascript#send-an-adaptive-card&preserve-view=true).
  * [Cards sample code Bot Builder v4](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/main/samples/javascript_nodejs/06.using-cards).

## Card types

You can identify and use different types of cards based on your application requirements. The following table shows the types of cards available to you:

| Card type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Adaptive Card](#adaptive-card) | This card is highly customizable and can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields. |
| [Hero card](#hero-card) | This card typically contains a single large image, one or more buttons, and a small amount of text. |
| [List card](#list-card) | This card contains a scrolling list of items. |
| [Connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups](#connector-card-for-microsoft-365-groups) | This card has a flexible layout with multiple sections, fields, images, and actions. |
| [Receipt card](#receipt-card) | This card provides a receipt to the user. |
| [Signin card](#sign-in-card) | This card enables a bot to request that a user signs in. |
| [Thumbnail card](#thumbnail-card) | This card typically contains a single thumbnail image, some short text, and one or more buttons. |
| [Card collections](#card-collections) | This card collection is used to return multiple items in a single response. |

## Features that support different card types

| Card type | Bots | Message extension previews | Message extension results | Dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) | Outgoing Webhooks | Incoming Webhooks | Connectors for Microsoft 365 Groups|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adaptive Card | ✔️ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups | ✔️ | ❌ | ✔️ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Hero card | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Thumbnail card | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |
| List card | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Receipt card | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ | ❌ |
| Sign in card | ✔️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

> [!NOTE]
>
> * For Adaptive Cards in Incoming Webhooks, all native Adaptive Card schema elements, except `Action.Submit`, are fully supported. The supported actions are [**Action.OpenURL**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.OpenUrl.html), [**Action.ShowCard**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.ShowCard.html), [**Action.ToggleVisibility**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.ToggleVisibility.html), and [**Action.Execute**](/adaptive-cards/authoring-cards/universal-action-model#actionexecute).
>
> * Adaptive Card supports only Incoming Webhook connectors for Microsoft 365 groups type. For these connectors, you can send the Adaptive Card using the following [format](../../webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using.md#send-adaptive-cards-using-an-incoming-webhook).

## Common properties for all cards

You can go through some common properties that are applicable to all cards.

> [!NOTE]
> Hero and thumbnail cards with multiple actions are automatically split into multiple cards in a carousel layout.

### Inline card images

The card can contain an inline image by including a link to the publicly available image. For performance purposes, it's highly recommended you host the image on a public Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Images are scaled up or down in size to maintain the aspect ratio for covering the image area. Images are then cropped from center to achieve the appropriate aspect ratio for the card.

Images must be at most 1024 × 1024 and in PNG, JPEG, or GIF format. Animated GIF isn't supported.

The following table provides the properties of inline card images:

| Property | Type  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| url | URL | HTTPS URL to the image. |
| alt | String | Accessible description of the image. |

> [!NOTE]
> If a card includes an image URL that is redirected before the final image, the redirect in image URL is not supported. This occurs for images shared on the public cloud.

### Buttons

Buttons are shown stacked at the bottom of the card. Button text is always on a single line and is truncated if the text exceeds the button width. Any additional buttons beyond the maximum number supported by the card aren't shown.

For more information, see [card actions](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions.md).

### Card formatting

For more information on text formatting in cards, see [card formatting](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md).

After identifying the common properties for all cards, you can now work with Adaptive Cards, which help you increase engagement and efficiency by adding your actionable content directly into the apps you use.

## Adaptive Card

An Adaptive Card is a customizable card that can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields. For more information, see [Adaptive Cards](https://github.com/microsoft/AdaptiveCards/releases/tag/2020.07).

### Support for Adaptive Cards

The following table provides the features that support Adaptive Cards:

| Bots in Teams | Message extensions  | Connectors | Bot Framework |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ | ✔️ |

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Teams platform supports v1.5 or earlier of Adaptive Card features for bot sent cards and action based message extensions.
> * Teams platform supports v1.5 or earlier of Adaptive Card features for other capabilities, such as cards sent by user (search based message extensions and link unfurling), tabs, and dialogs.
> * Positive or destructive action styling is not supported in Adaptive Cards on the Teams platform.
> * Test your full width Adaptive Card in narrow form factors such as mobile and meeting side panels to ensure that content is not truncated.
> * Adaptive Cards within Teams don't provide support for file or image uploads.
> * The `isEnabled` property for `Action.Submit` type in an Adaptive Card isn't supported in Teams.

## Connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups

You can work with an connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups that provides a flexible layout and is a great way to get useful information. The connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups is supported in Teams, not in Bot Framework. This card provides a flexible layout with multiple sections, fields, images, and actions. This card contains a connector card so that it can be used by bots. For differences between connector cards and the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups, see [Connector card for Microsoft 365 Groupsd](#additional-information-on-the-connector-card-for-microsoft-365-groups).

### Support for connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups

The following table provides the features that support connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups:

| Bots in Teams | Message extensions  | Connectors | Bot Framework |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ |

### Properties of the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups

The following table provides the properties of the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups:

| Property | Type  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| title | Rich text | Title of the card. Maximum two lines. |
| summary | Rich text | Required if the card does not contain a text property, otherwise optional. The summary property is typically displayed in the notification pop-up in Teams, as a way to quickly determine what the card is all about.<br><br> **Do** always include a summary.<br> **Don't** include the details in the summary. For example, for a Twitter post, a summary might simply read **New tweet from @someuser** without mentioning the content of the tweet itself.|
| text | Rich text | Text appears under the subtitle. For formatting options, see [card formatting](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md). |
| themeColor | HEX string | Color that overrides the `accentColor` provided from the application manifest. |

For more information on the properties of the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups, see [card fields](/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference).

### Additional information on the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups

Connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups function properly in Microsoft Teams, including [`ActionCard` actions](/outlook/actionable-messages/card-reference#actioncard-action).

The important difference between using connector cards from a connector and using connector cards in your bot is the handling of card actions. The following table lists the difference:

| Connector | Bot |
| --- | --- |
| The endpoint receives the card payload through HTTP POST. | The `HttpPOST` action triggers an `invoke` activity that sends only the action ID and body to the bot.|

Each connector card can display a maximum of 10 sections, and each section can contain a maximum of five images and five actions.

> [!NOTE]
> Any additional sections, images, or actions in a message do not appear.

All text fields support Markdown and HTML. You can control which sections use Markdown or HTML by setting the `markdown` property in a message. By default, `markdown` is set to `true`. If you want to use HTML instead, set `markdown` to `false`.

If you specify the `themeColor` property, it overrides the `accentColor` property in the app manifest.

To specify the rendering style for `activityImage`, you can set `activityImageType` as shown in the following table:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `avatar` | Default, `activityImage` is cropped as a circle. |
| `article` | `activityImage` is displayed as a rectangle and retains its aspect ratio. |

For all other details about connector card properties, see [actionable message card reference](/outlook/actionable-messages/card-reference). The only connector card properties that Teams doesn't currently support are as follows:

* `heroImage`
* `hideOriginalBody`
* `startGroup` always treated as `true` in Teams
* `originator`
* `correlationId`

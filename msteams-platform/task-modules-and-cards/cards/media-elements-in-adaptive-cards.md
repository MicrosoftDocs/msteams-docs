# Media elements in Adaptive Card

Media elements in Adaptive Card provides enhanced media experience and increases engagement with the Adaptive Card. You can add media files such as audio or video clips to your Adaptive Card.

Adaptive Card plays the video or audio clips by accessing the media files available in OneDrive or SharePoint. You can view the media files within the Adaptive Card in Teams.

The following screenshot shows you the media elements in your Adaptive Card:

> [!NOTE]
> For desktop clients, Adaptive cards support inline and full screen playback, whereas for mobile clients, the experience is limited to full screen and picture-in-picture (PiP) (which allows you to watch video in floating window when you open the other apps).

## Add media elements to your Adaptive Card

You can add media files to an existing or new Adaptive Card using Teams Developer Portal or Adaptive Card Designer. To add media files to your Adaptive Card, follow the steps:

1. Add your media files to OneDrive or SharePoint.

1. [Create a sharing link or URL for a DriveItem](/graph/api/driveitem-createlink). You can also get a link or URL using the **Share**, **Copy link**, or **Copy link at current time** options from OneDrive or SharePoint.

    >[!NOTE]
    > Adaptive Card does't support media file links or URL that are copied directly from the address bar.

1. Open an existing Adaptive Card or create a new Adaptive Card using [Teams Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/cards) or [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer).

1. From the left pane, under **Elements**, select **Media** and add it to your Adaptive Card.

{
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "version": "1.6",
  "fallbackText": "This card requires CaptionSource to be viewed. Ask your platform to update to Adaptive Cards v1.6 for this and more!",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "Media",
      "poster": "https://adaptivecards.io/content/poster-video.png",
      "sources": [
    {
          "mimeType": "video/mp4",
          "url": "https://adaptivecardsblob.blob.core.windows.net/assets/AdaptiveCardsOverviewVideo.mp4"
    }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

```

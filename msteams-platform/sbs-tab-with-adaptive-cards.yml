    Adaptive Card tabs in Teams provide a unique method to display information. Instead of embedding web content in an iFrame, you can render Adaptive Cards to a tab. While the front end is rendered with Adaptive Cards, the backend is powered by a bot. The bot handles accepting requests and responding appropriately with the Adaptive Card that is rendered.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Adaptive Card tabs aren't available in the new Teams client. The Classic Teams client is expected to be deprecated by March 31, 2024. If your app is using Adaptive Card tabs, we recommend you to rebuild the tab as a [web-based tab](tabs/what-are-tabs.md).

    You can build your tabs with relevant user interface (UI) building blocks, which are native to desktop, web, and mobile.

    This article helps you to understand:
    
    * Changes required to be made to the app manifest.
    * Identifies how the invoke activity requests and sends information in tab with the Adaptive Cards.
    * Effects on the dialog (referred as task module in TeamsJS v1.x) workflow.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you build tabs with Adaptive Cards on desktop and mobile. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

     &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. Use the latest version or install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> Or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm devDependencies). |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

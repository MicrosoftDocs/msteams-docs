    Adaptive Card tabs are a new way to build tabs in Teams. Instead of embedding web content in an IFrame, you can render Adaptive Cards to a tab. While the front end is rendered with Adaptive Cards, the backend is powered by a bot. The bot is responsible for accepting requests and responding appropriately with the Adaptive Card that is rendered.

    You can build your tabs with relevant user interface (UI) building blocks native on desktop, web, and mobile.

    This article helps you understand:
    
    * The changes required to be made to the app manifest.
    * Identifies how the invoke activity requests and sends information in tab with Adaptive Cards.
    * Effect on the task module workflow.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to build tabs with Adaptive Cards in desktop and mobile.

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **To create Azure Bot resource**

    1. Select the **F5** key to run this project.

- title: Configure and upload the app in Teams
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    The most comprehensive way to test your bot is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your bot, across all scopes. You can configure and run the Teams app by uploading the **manifest.zip** file.

    **To run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file**
    
    1. In the Windows Explorer, go to **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > tab-adaptive-cards > csharp > TabWithAdpativeCardFlow > AppPackage** to open the folder.
    1. Open the **manifest.json** file in Visual Studio Code.
    1. In the **manifest.json** file, find **{TODO: contentBotId}** and add your Microsoft App ID and save.
    1. In Windows Explorer, go to the **AppPackage** folder.
    1. Zip the contents of the **AppPackage** folder to create **manifest.zip**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The **manifest.zip** should not contain any additional folders in it. It should have **manifest** json source file, **color** icon, and **outline** icon inside the zip folder.

    1. Go to Teams.
    1. To upload **manifest.zip**, select **Store > Manage your apps > Upload a custom app** and open **manifest.zip**.
    1. Select **Add** to add the conversation bot to your chat.

        :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/adaptive-cards/tab-in-teams.png" alt-text="Tab in Teams app":::

        You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The Bot exchanges an SSO token and makes a call to the Graph API on your behalf and returns the results. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to **logout**.

    1. Send a message to the bot. The conversation bot asks for permissions for the first time.

        (Image to be replaced)

    *  **Submit function of Adaptive Card**
       **task/submit** request is triggered to your bot with the corresponding data through the Action.

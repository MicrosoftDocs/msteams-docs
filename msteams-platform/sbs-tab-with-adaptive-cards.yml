    Adaptive Card tabs are a new way to build tabs in Teams. Instead of embedding web content in an iFrame, you can render Adaptive Cards to a tab. While the front end is rendered with Adaptive Cards, the backend is powered by a bot. The bot is responsible for accepting requests and responding appropriately with the Adaptive Card that is rendered.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Adaptive Card tabs will be deprecated in the new Microsoft Teams, which is expected to release by June 2023. If your app is using Adaptive Card tabs, it's recommended to rebuild the tab as a web-based tab. For more information, see [Build tabs for Teams](tabs/what-are-tabs.md).

    You can build your tabs with relevant user interface (UI) building blocks, which are native to desktop, web, and mobile.

    This article helps you to understand:
    
    * Changes required to be made to the app manifest.
    * Identifies how the invoke activity requests and sends information in tab with the Adaptive Cards.
    * Effects on the task module workflow.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to build tabs with the Adaptive Cards on desktop and mobile. You'll see the following output:

- title: Create and register your bot
  durationInMinutes: 2

    Register your bot with Azure Bot service when you develop and host it in Azure. Perform the following steps:

    1. Create a ngrok tunnel to your web server's endpoints.
    1. Create Azure Bot resource to register bot with Azure Bot service.
    1. Create client secret that enables single sign-on (SSO) authentication of the bot.
    1. Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    1. Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **To create Azure Bot resource**

    1. Open [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource**.

# Build apps for anonymous users

Anonymous users don't have a Microsoft Entra identity and aren't federated with a tenant. The anonymous participants are external users but their identity isn't shown in the meeting. An anonymous user can be a presenter or an attendee but can't be an organizer. You can build bots, messaging extensions, cards, and dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) in your app to engage with anonymous meeting participants.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Apps for anonymous users are supported in the new Teams desktop and mobile clients for Windows and Mac.
> * Meeting apps for anonymous users are only supported in Microsoft Edge and Chrome.

For anonymous users to interact with the apps in Teams meetings, ensure to:

1. Update your [app manifest](#app-manifest-update-for-anonymous-users).
2. Enable the [anonymous user app interaction](#admin-setting-for-anonymous-user-app-interaction) in Teams admin center.

## App manifest update for anonymous users

> [!NOTE]
> The `supportsAnonymousGuestUsers` property in the app manifest schema v1.16 is supported only in [new Teams client](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/teams-updates).

To allow anonymous users to interact with the tab app, update the `supportsAnonymousGuestUsers` property to `true` in your app manifest schema v1.16 or later. Following is an example of the manifest:

```json
"meetingExtensionDefinition": {
    "supportsAnonymousGuestUsers": true
}
```

For more information, see [app manifest schema.](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#meetingextensiondefinition)

## Anonymous user authentication flow

Anonymous users can't be authenticated through Microsoft Entra authentication or `getAuthToken` from the client SDK as they aren't Microsoft Entra accounts. `getAuthToken` fails for anonymous users by returning the error `useGetAuthToken: Failed with error - User is not authenticated`. If you need to authenticate anonymous users, your app must identify anonymous users and provide an alternative authentication experience in the meetings. You can determine if a user is anonymous by validating [user's context](#in-meeting-getcontext-from-teams-client-library).

## Admin setting for anonymous user app interaction

Teams admins can use the Teams admin center to enable or disable anonymous user app interaction for the entire tenant. If your app needs to be accessed by anonymous users, ensure that the tenant admins enable the anonymous user app interaction. This setting is enabled by default. For more information, see [allow anonymous users to interact with apps in meetings](/microsoftteams/meeting-settings-in-teams).

To test your apps experience for anonymous users, select the URL in the meeting invite and join the meeting from a private browser window.

## In-Meeting getContext from Teams client library

Apps receive the following information for an anonymous user when they call the `getContext` API from the [shared app stage](~/apps-in-teams-meetings/build-apps-for-teams-meeting-stage.md). You can recognize anonymous users by checking for a `userLicenseType` value of `Anonymous`.

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
import * as microsoftTeams from "@microsoft/teams-js";

microsoftTeams.app.getContext().then((context) => {
    if (context.user.licenseType === "Anonymous") {
        // Add your custom logic here
    }
});
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

```json
{
   "app": {
    "locale": "en-us",
    "sessionId": "e0024c2a-067f-4f43-8423-6acac718b7a0",
    "theme": "dark",
    "parentMessageId": "",
    "userClickTime": 1675776700117,
    "host": {
        "name": "Teams",
        "clientType": "web",
        "sessionId": "",
        "ringId": "general"
    }
  },
  "page": {
    "frameContext": "meetingStage",
    "subPageId": "",
    "isMultiWindow": false,
    "sourceOrigin": ""
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "",
    "licenseType": "Anonymous",
    "loginHint": "",
    "userPrincipalName": ""
 },
 "chat": {
      "id": "19:meeting_ZmMyNWZjMzEtMWU0Mi00NDNmLWJhMmYtNjM4OTY0YmM0NWM2@thread.v2"
 },
  "meeting": {
      "id": "MCMxOTptZWV0aW5nX1ptTXlOV1pqTXpFdE1XVTBNaTAwTkRObUxXSmhNbVl0TmpNNE9UWTBZbU0wTldNMkB0aHJlYWQudjIjMA=="
    }
}
```

---

| **Property name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `userObjectId` | Empty string for anonymous user. |
| `userLicenseType` | `Anonymous` represents anonymous user. |
| `loginHint` | Empty string for anonymous user. |
| `userPrincipalName` | Empty string for anonymous user. |

For more information on `getContext`, see [get context by using the Microsoft Teams JavaScript library.](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md#get-context-by-using-the-microsoft-teams-javascript-library)

## Bot activities and APIs

With a few differences, the activities sent to your bot and the responses that it receives from bot APIs are consistent between anonymous and non-anonymous meeting participants.

### Get members and get single member APIs

The [get members](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/get-teams-context#fetch-the-roster-or-user-profile) and [get single member](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/get-teams-context#get-single-member-details) APIs return limited information for anonymous users:

```json
{ 
  "id": "<GUID1>", 
  "name": "<AnonTest (Guest)>",  
  "tenantId": "<GUID2>", 
  "userRole": "anonymous" 
}
```

| **Property name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Unique generated value for the anonymous user. |
| `name` | Name provided by the anonymous user when joining the meeting. |
| `tenantId` | Tenant ID of the meeting organizer. |
| `userRole` | `anonymous`, represents anonymous user. |

### ConversationUpdate activity MembersAdded and MembersRemoved

`MembersAdded`

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsMembersAddedAsync(IList<TeamsChannelAccount> membersAdded, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
     foreach (var teamMember in membersAdded)
     {
         // If UserRole == "anonymous", it indicates an anonymous user
         if (teamMember.UserRole == "anonymous" )
          {
             // Add your custom logic here
          }
          else
          {
           // Add your custom logic here
          }
     }
  }
```

`MembersRemoved`

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsMembersRemovedAsync(IList<TeamsChannelAccount> membersRemoved, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
   foreach (var member in membersRemoved)
   {
      // If AadObjectId is null, it indicates an anonymous user
       if (member.AadObjectId == null)
       {
           // Add your custom logic here
       }
       else
       {
           // Add your custom logic here
       }
   }
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> When an anonymous user joins or leaves a meeting, the `from` object in the payload always has the ID of the meeting organizer, even if the action was taken by someone else.

### Create Conversation API

Bots aren't allowed to initiate a one-on-one conversation with an anonymous user. If a bot calls the [Create Conversation API](/dotnet/api/microsoft.bot.builder.botframeworkadapter.createconversationasync) with the user ID of an anonymous user, it receives a `400` Bad Request status code and the following error response:

```csharp
var conversationParameters = new ConversationParameters
    {
       IsGroup = false,
       Bot = turnContext.Activity.Recipient,
       Members = new ChannelAccount[] { teamMember },
       TenantId = turnContext.Activity.Conversation.TenantId,
    };
    
    await ((CloudAdapter)turnContext.Adapter).CreateConversationAsync(
    conversationParameters,
    async (t1, c1) =>
    {
       conversationReference = t1.Activity.GetConversationReference();
       await ((CloudAdapter)turnContext.Adapter).ContinueConversationAsync(
       _appId,
       conversationReference,
       async (t2, c2) =>
       {
         await t2.SendActivityAsync(proactiveMessage, c2);
        },
        cancellationToken);
    },
cancellationToken);
```

```json
{ 
  "error": {
    "code": "BadArgument",
    "message": "Bot cannot create a conversation with an anonymous user"
  }
} 
```

### Adaptive Cards

Anonymous users can view and interact with Adaptive Cards in the meeting chat. Adaptive Card actions behave the same way for anonymous and non-anonymous users. For more information, see [Card actions](/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions?tabs=json).

## Known issues and limitations

* Apps for anonymous users aren't supported on live event, Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and Linux platforms.

* Apps for anonymous users aren't supported on Firefox and Safari browsers.

* Apps for anonymous users aren't supported in Teams channel meetings.

* Currently, the `getContext` API doesn't return a user ID for the anonymous user though the bot APIs do and it's not possible to correlate the anonymous user between these two APIs.

* Anonymous users see a generic app icon on bot messages and cards, instead of the app's actual icon.

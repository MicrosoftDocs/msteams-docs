# Dice Roller code tutorial

In the Dice Roller sample app, users are shown a dice with a button to roll it. When the dice is rolled, the Live Share SDK uses the Fluid Framework to sync the data across clients, so everyone sees the same result. To sync data, perform the following steps in the [app.js](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk/blob/main/samples/javascript/01.dice-roller/src/app.js) file:

1. [Set up the application](#set-up-the-application)
2. [Join a Fluid container](#join-a-fluid-container)
3. [Write the meeting Stageview](#write-the-stageview)
4. [Connect meeting Stageview to Live Share](#connect-meeting-stageview-to-live-share)
5. [Write the side panel view](#write-the-side-panel-view)
6. [Write the settings view](#write-the-settings-view)

## Set up the application

You can start by importing the required modules. The sample uses the [LiveState DDS](/javascript/api/@microsoft/live-share/livestate) and [LiveShareClient](/javascript/api/@microsoft/live-share/liveshareclient) from the Live Share SDK. The sample supports Teams Meeting Extensibility so you must include the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library (TeamsJS)](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-library-js). Finally, the sample is designed to run both locally and in a Teams meeting so you need to include more Fluid Framework pieces to [test the sample locally](https://fluidframework.com/docs/testing/testing/#azure-fluid-relay-as-an-abstraction-for-tinylicious).

Applications create Fluid containers using a schema that defines a set of _initial objects_ that are available to the container. The sample uses a LiveState to store the current dice value that was rolled.

Teams meeting apps require multiple views, such as content, configuration, and stage. You can create a `start()` function to help identify the view. This helps to render and perform any initialization that's required. The app supports running both locally in a web browser and from within a Teams meeting. The `start()` function looks for an `inTeams=true` query parameter to determine if it's running in Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> When running in Teams, your application needs to call `app.initialize()` prior to calling any other teams-js methods.

In addition to the `inTeams=true` query parameter, you can use a `view=content|config|stage` query parameter to determine the view that needs to be rendered.

```js
import { app, pages, LiveShareHost } from "@microsoft/teams-js";
import { LiveShareClient, TestLiveShareHost, LiveState } from "@microsoft/live-share";

const searchParams = new URL(window.location).searchParams;
const root = document.getElementById("content");

// Define container schema

const containerSchema = {
  initialObjects: { diceState: LiveState },
};

// STARTUP LOGIC

async function start() {
  // Check for page to display
  let view = searchParams.get("view") || "stage";

  // Check if we are running on stage.
  if (!!searchParams.get("inTeams")) {
    // Initialize teams app
    await app.initialize();
  }

  // Load the requested view
  switch (view) {
    case "content":
      renderSidePanel(root);
      break;
    case "config":
      renderSettings(root);
      break;
    case "stage":
    default:
      const { container } = await joinContainer();
      renderStage(container.initialObjects.diceState, root);
      break;
  }
}

start().catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

## Join a Fluid container

Not all of your app's views need to be collaborative. The `stage` view _always_ needs collaborative features, the `content` view _may_ need collaborative features, and the `config` view should _never_ need collaborative features. For the views that do need collaborative features you'll need to join a Fluid container associated with the current meeting.

Joining the container for the meeting is as simple as initializing the `LiveShareClient` with a `LiveShareHost` instance from the Teams Client SDK, and then calling its `joinContainer()` method.

When running locally, you can initialize `LiveShareClient` with a `TestLiveShareHost` instance instead.

```js
async function joinContainer() {
  // Are we running in teams? If so, use LiveShareHost, otherwise use TestLiveShareHost
  const host = !!searchParams.get("inTeams")
    ? LiveShareHost.create()
    : TestLiveShareHost.create();
  // Create client
  const client = new LiveShareClient(host);
  // Join container
  return await client.joinContainer(containerSchema, onContainerFirstCreated);
}
```

When testing locally, `TestLiveShareHost` updates the browser URL to contain the ID of the test container that was created. Copying that link to other browser tabs causes the `LiveShareClient` to join the test container that was created. If the modification of the applications URL interferes with the operation of the application, the strategy used to store the test containers ID can be customized using the [setLocalTestContainerId](/javascript/api/@microsoft/live-share/iliveshareclientoptions) and [getLocalTestContainerId](/javascript/api/@microsoft/live-share/iliveshareclientoptions) options passed to `LiveShareClient`.

## Write the Stageview

Many Teams Meeting Extensibility applications are designed to use React for their view framework, but this isn't required. For example, this sample uses standard HTML/DOM methods to render a view.

### Start with a static view

It's easy to create the view using local data without any Fluid functionality, then add Fluid by changing some key pieces of the app.

The `renderStage` function appends the `stageTemplate` to the passed HTML element and creates a working dice roller with a random dice value each time the **Roll** button is selected. The `diceState` is used in the next few steps.

```js
const stageTemplate = document.createElement("template");

stageTemplate["innerHTML"] = `
  <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="dice"></div>
    <button class="roll"> Roll </button>
  </div>
`;
function renderStage(diceState, elem) {
  elem.appendChild(stageTemplate.content.cloneNode(true));
  const rollButton = elem.querySelector(".roll");
  const dice = elem.querySelector(".dice");

  const updateDice = () => {
    // Get a random value between 1 and 6
    const diceValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    // Unicode 0x2680-0x2685 are the sides of a die (⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅).
    dice.textContent = String.fromCodePoint(0x267f + value);
  };
  rollButton.onclick = () => updateDice();
  updateDice(1);
}
```

## Connect meeting Stageview to Live Share

### Modify LiveState

To begin using Live Share in the application, the first thing to change is what happens when the user selects the `rollButton`. Instead of updating the local state directly, the button updates the number stored as a `state` value in `diceState`. Whenever you call `.set()` with a new `state`, that value is distributed to all clients. Any changes to the `diceState` can cause a `stateChanged` event to be emitted, and an event handler can trigger an update of the view.

This pattern is common in Fluid and Live Share distributed data structures because it enables the view to behave the same way for both local and remote changes.

```js
rollButton.onclick = () =>
  diceState.set(Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1);
```

### Rely on Fluid data

The next change that needs to be made is to change the `updateDice` function to retrieve the latest dice value from the `LiveState` each time `updateDice` is called.

```js
const updateDice = () => {
  const diceValue = diceState.state;
  dice.textContent = String.fromCodePoint(0x267f + diceValue);
};
```

### Handle remote changes

The values returned from `diceState` are only a snapshot in time. To keep the data up-to-date as it changes, an event handler must be registered with `diceState` to call `updateDice` each time that the `stateChanged` event is sent.

```js
diceState.on("stateChanged", updateDice);
```

### Initialize LiveState

Before you can begin receiving the Live Share changes in the application, you must first call `initialize()` on your `LiveState` object with an initial value. This initial value doesn't overwrite any existing state that was sent by other users.

After you've initialized `LiveState`, the `stateChanged` event you registered earlier starts to trigger whenever a change is made. However, to update the UI within the initial value, call `updateDice()`.

```js
await diceState.initialize(1);
updateDice();
```

## Write the side panel view

The side panel view, loaded through the tab `contentUrl` with the `sidePanel` frame context, is displayed to the user in a side panel when they open your app within a meeting. The goal of side panel view is to let a user select content for the app prior to sharing the app to the meeting stage. For the Live Share SDK apps, the side panel view can also be used as a companion experience for the app. Calling `joinContainer()` from the side panel view connects to the same Fluid container the Stageview is connected to. This container can then be used to communicate with the Stageview. Ensure that you're communicating with everyone's Stageview and side panel view.

The sample's side panel view prompts the user to select the share to stage button.

```js
const sidePanelTemplate = document.createElement("template");

sidePanelTemplate["innerHTML"] = `
  <style>
    .wrapper { text-align: center }
    .title { font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; }
    .text { font-size: medium; }
  </style>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <p class="title">Lets get started</p>
    <p class="text">Press the share to stage button to share Dice Roller to the meeting stage.</p>
  </div>
`;

function renderSidePanel(elem) {
  elem.appendChild(sidePanelTemplate.content.cloneNode(true));
}
```

## Write the settings view

The settings view, loaded through `configurationUrl` in your [app manifest](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#configurabletabs), is shown to a user when they first add your app to a Teams meeting. This view lets the developer configure the `contentUrl` for the tab that is pinned to the meeting based on user input. This page is currently required even if no user input is required to set the `contentUrl`.

> [!NOTE]
> The Live Share's' `joinContainer()` is not supported in the tab `settings` context.

The sample's settings view prompts the user to select the save button.

```js
const settingsTemplate = document.createElement("template");

settingsTemplate["innerHTML"] = `
  <style>
    .wrapper { text-align: center }
    .title { font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; }
    .text { font-size: medium; }
  </style>
  <div class="wrapper">
    <p class="title">Welcome to Dice Roller!</p>
    <p class="text">Press the save button to continue.</p>
  </div>
`;

function renderSettings(elem) {
  elem.appendChild(settingsTemplate.content.cloneNode(true));

  // Save the configurable tab
  pages.config.registerOnSaveHandler((saveEvent) => {
    pages.config.setConfig({
      websiteUrl: window.location.origin,
      contentUrl: window.location.origin + "?inTeams=1&view=content",
      entityId: "DiceRollerFluidLiveShare",
      suggestedDisplayName: "DiceRollerFluidLiveShare",
    });
    saveEvent.notifySuccess();
  });

  // Enable the Save button in config dialog
  pages.config.setValidityState(true);
}
```

## Test locally

You can test your app locally, using `npm run start`. For more information, see [quick start guide](./teams-live-share-quick-start.md).

## Test in Teams

After you've started running your app locally with `npm run start`, you can then test your app on Teams. If you want to test your app without deployment, download and use the [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) tunneling service.

### Create a ngrok tunnel to allow Teams to reach your app

1. Download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).

1. Use ngrok to create a tunnel with port 8080. Run the following command:

   ```bash
    ngrok http 8080 --host-header=localhost
   ```

   A new ngrok terminal opens with a new url, for example `https:...ngrok.io`. The new URL is the tunnel that points to your app, which needs to be updated in your app `manifest.json`.

### Create the app package to upload into Teams

1. Go to the Dice Roller sample folder `live-share-sdk\samples\javascript\01.dice-roller` on your computer. You can also check the [manifest.json](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk/blob/main/samples/javascript/01.dice-roller/manifest/manifest.json) from the Dice Roller sample on GitHub.

1. Open manifest.json and update the configuration URL.

   Replace `https://<<BASE_URI_DOMAIN>>` with your http endpoint from ngrok.

1. You can update the following fields:

   - Set `developer.name` to your name.
   - Update `developer.websiteUrl` with your website.
   - Update `developer.privacyUrl` with your privacy policy.
   - Update `developer.termsOfUseUrl` with your terms of use.

1. Zip the contents of the manifest folder to create `manifest.zip`. Ensure that the `manifest.zip` contains only the `manifest.json` source file, `color` icon, and the `outline` icon.

   1. On Windows, select all files in `.\manifest` directory and compress them.

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > - Don't zip the containing folder.
   > - Give your zip file a descriptive name. For example, `DiceRollerLiveShare`.

   For more information on manifest, visit the [Teams manifest documentation](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md)

### Upload your custom app into a meeting

1. Open Teams.

1. Schedule a meeting from the calendar in Teams. Ensure you invite at least one attendee to the meeting.

1. Join the meeting.

1. In the meeting window at the top, select **+ Apps** > **Manage apps**.

1. In the **Manage apps** pane, select **Upload a custom app**.

   1. If you don't see the option to **Upload a custom app**, follow [instructions](/microsoftteams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings) to enable custom apps in your tenant.

1. Select and upload the `manifest.zip` file from your computer.

1. Select **Add** to add your sample app into the meeting.

1. Select **+ Apps**, type Dice Roller in the **Find an app** search box.

1. Select the app to activate it in the meeting.

1. Select **Save**.

   The Dice Roller app is added to the Teams meeting panel.

1. In the side panel, select the share to stage icon. Teams starts a live sync with the users on the meeting stage in the meeting.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-live-share/teams-live-share-to-stage.png" alt-text="share to stage icon":::

   You should now see dice-roller on the meeting stage.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-live-share/teams-live-share-meeting-stage.png" alt-text="meeting stage image":::

Users invited to the meeting can see your app on stage when they join the meeting.

## Deployment

After you're ready to deploy your code, you can use Teams Toolkit or the Teams Developer Portal to provision and upload your app's zip file.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to add your provisioned appId to the `manifest.json` before uploading or distributing the app.

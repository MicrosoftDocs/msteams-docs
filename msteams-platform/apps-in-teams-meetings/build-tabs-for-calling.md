# Build tabs for PSTN calling extensibility

You can now create personal scope apps that integrate seamlessly with Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and Teams-to-Teams calls. By using the right scope and context, you can build apps that utilize tab type, static scope, personal context, and meeting side panels effectively.

This integration is simple. You can create a new personal tab app or update an existing tab app with personal scope and the appropriate context. It ensures calling functionality across different communication mediums. Although PSTN traditionally doesn't support apps due to the lack of a chat thread, passing the caller ID to the app allows it to display relevant information such as active cases or billing issues. This enhances the app's utility and provides a richer experience for users during calls.

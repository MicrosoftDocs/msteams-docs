# Apps for Teams meetings

Meetings enable collaboration, partnership, informed communication, and shared feedback. The meeting app can deliver a user experience for each stage of the meeting lifecycle. Meeting lifecycle includes pre-meeting, in-meeting, and post-meeting app experience, depending on the attendee's status.

Teams supports access to apps during meeting for the following meeting types:

* Calendar scheduled meetings
* One-on-one calls
* Group calls
* Calendar Meet now

Users can add apps to the meeting using the + option from their Teams. Visit the [Teams store](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=2183121&clcid=0x4009&culture=en-in&country=IN) and explore apps designed specifically for meetings.

> [!Note]
> Meeting apps are currently not available for external users or people outside the organization.

The following illustration gives you an idea of the meeting app extensibility features:

This article provides an overview of meeting app extensibility, API references, enable and configure apps for meetings, and custom Together Mode scenes in Teams.

Enhance your meeting experience by using the meeting extensibility feature. This feature enables you to integrate your apps within meetings. It also includes different stages of a meeting lifecycle, where you can integrate tabs, bots, and message extensions. You can identify various participant roles and user types, get meeting events, and generate in-meeting dialogs.

To customize Teams with apps for meetings, enable your apps for Teams meetings by updating the app manifest and also configure the apps for meeting scenarios.

The new custom Together Mode scenes feature enables users to collaborate in a meeting with their team in one place.

    This tutorial shows how to create Custom Copilot with Copilot SDK using Teams Toolkit and interact with your Large Language Model (LLM) on Teams. Copilot SDK streamlines the process of building intelligent Teams apps by using the AI components and LLM of your choice.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

    * How to setup your data on Azure OpenAI.
    * How to create a new Custom Copilot with Teams Toolkit.
    * How to interact with your Large Language Model and data.
    * The directory structure of your Custom Copilot.

   Ensure you install the following tools for building and deploying your apps.

   | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | &nbsp; | [Teams Toolkit](~/toolkit/install-Teams-Toolkit.md) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest version. |
   | &nbsp; | [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
   | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
   | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |
   | &nbsp; | [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/portal)| First create your OpenAI API key to use OpenAI's GPT. If you want to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must create an Azure OpenAI service.|

     1. Let's customize the prompt for your Custom Copilot. Go to `src/prompts/chat/skprompt.txt` and update the following code in `skprompt.txt` file:

        ```skprompt.txt
        This is a conversation with an AI assistant specialized in the vast and intriguing universe of planets and space.
        Encourage the AI to provide vivid and captivating explanations that spark curiosity and enhance learning.
        Brighten the conversation with emojis! They add a playful and visually engaging element that makes learning about space more fun.
        At the end of each response, share a fascinating fun fact about space or planets. These snippets aim to amaze and provide extra tidbits of knowledge!
        ```
        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/prompts-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows skprompt in explorer in Visual Studio Code.":::

     1. Under `completion` go to `config.json` file. Update the following code and replace the `endpoint` and `key` values with your Azure AI Search resource details:

        ```json
           "data_sources": [
             {
                    "type": "azure_search",
                    "parameters": {
                         "endpoint": "AZURE-AI-SEARCH-ENDPOINT",
                         "index_name": "nba",
                         "authentication": {

                           }
                     }
               }
             ]
        ```

     1. Go to `src/app/app.js` file and add the following variable inside `OpenAIModel`: 

        ```javascript

        ```
 
     1. From the left pane, select **Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)**.

     1. Select **Debug in Test Tool (Preview)**.
     
     1. Select the **F5** key.

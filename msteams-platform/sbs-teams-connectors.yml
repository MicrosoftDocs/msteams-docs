    Microsoft Teams connector is Model-View-Controller (MVC) sample task management application and generated using the ASP.NET web application template. Most of the code is related to either basic MVC configuration or task management system. You can add your existing connector for Microsoft 365 Groups or build a new one within Teams.
    
    **Types of connector codes**

      * **ConnectorController.cs**: Set up and save actions.
      * **TaskController.cs**: Create and update actions.
      
    **Key features of Microsoft Teams connector**

      * Simulates real task management system.
      * Allows users to create and view tasks.
      * Generates content randomly. 
      * Simulates notification to be sent to Microsoft Teams channel. 
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create and test a connector in Microsoft Teams. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment: 

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and calls all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version.|
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. Use the latest version or install the portable version.|
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
   
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

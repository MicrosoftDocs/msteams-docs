    Microsoft Teams connector is Model-View-Controller (MVC) sample task management application. The application is generated using the ASP.NET web application template. Most of the code is related to either basic MVC configuration or task management system. You can add your existing Office 365 Connector or build a new one within Teams.
    
    **Types of connector codes**

      * **ConnectorController.cs**: Set up and save actions
      * **TaskController.cs**: Create and update actions

    **Key features of Microsoft Teams connector**

      * Simulates real task management system.
      * Allows users to create and view tasks.
      * Generates content randomly. 
      * Simulates notification to be sent to Microsoft Teams channel. 
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create and test a connector in Microsoft Teams. You'll see the following output:

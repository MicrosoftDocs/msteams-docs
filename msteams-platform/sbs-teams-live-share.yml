   Live Share SDK allows you to build collaborative apps and discover more ways to collaborate and connect through Teams. You can build apps to share content such as watching movies, playing live games, and so on, in Teams one-on-one calls, group calls, schedule meetings, and meet now.
  
   This step-by-step guide helps you to create a Agile Poker sample app using Live Share SDK. You'll see the following output:

   You install the following tools and set up your development environment: 

    | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call all in one place.|
    | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
    | &nbsp; | [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
    | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
           
    > [!NOTE]
    > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    1. Go to the [Agile Poker](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk/tree/main/samples/javascript/22.react-agile-poker) sample app.

    1. Clone the Live Share SDK repository to test the sample app:
       ```
         git clone https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk.git
    
       ```
    1. Open a terminal window.

    1. Run the following command to go to the Agile Poker sample app folder:

        ```
        cd live-share-sdk\samples\javascript\22.react-agile-poker
        ```
    1. Run the following command to install the dependency package:

        ```
        npm install
        ```
        
    1. Run the following command to start the client and the local server:

        ```
        npm run start
        ```

       A new browser tab opens a http://localhost:3000 window and the Agile Poker game appears.

    1. Open a new ngrok terminal window to create a tunnel and deploy your app locally.

    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3000:

        ```
        ngrok http 3000--host-header=localhost
        ```
        ngrok tunnel is created.

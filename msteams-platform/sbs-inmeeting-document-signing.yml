    Meeting signing is a Microsoft Teams sample app that enables users to sign documents in real time scenarios. It provides enhanced experience by allowing the users to review and sign documents in a single session during meetings.
    This sample lets users electronically sign documents with their current tenant identity. The users can sign the following documents during meetings:
    * Purchase agreements.
    * Purchase orders.
    
    The template is also applicable for other scenarios, such as for reviewing and approving code samples and collaborative documents.
    The users can customize to incorporate other types of signatures: 
    * Handwritten signatures.
    * Certificate-based signatures.

    This step-by-step guide helps you to build in-meeting document signing app. You'll see the following output after you've completed this guide:

    Ensure that you install the following tools to set up your development environment:

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call-all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. Use the latest version or install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |

      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).
      > [!TIP]
      > Ensure the Microsoft Teams account isn't a guest account.

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

       A **tenant** is like a space or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also sideload and test the app.

    ### Check for sideloading option

       After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. It's known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

       > [!NOTE]
       > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable Sideloading to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

       Do you already have a tenant, and do you have admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    To verify sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload an app**
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-inmeeting-doc-signing/upload-custom-app1.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > Contact your Teams administrator, if you don't find the option to upload a custom app.  

    ## Download the code sample

      You must use the [In-Meeting Document Signing](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/meetings-share-to-stage-signing/csharp) code sample for this step-by-step guide. To use the code sample, clone the repository from GitHub.

- title: Create and register your app
  durationInMinutes: 5

    The following steps help you to create and register your app in Azure portal.

    * Create an app registration in Azure AD.
    * Use ngrok to create a tunnel.
    
    ## Create an app registration in Azure AD

    Register a new app in Azure AD and configure the tenancy and app's platform. You'll generate a new app ID that will be updated later in your Teams app manifest file.

    ### To register a new app in Azure AD

    1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
    
    2. Select the **App registrations** icon.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-inmeeting-doc-signing/azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Azure AD Portal page.":::

    3. Select **+ New registration** icon.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-inmeeting-doc-signing/app-registrations.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the New registration page on Azure AD Portal.":::

    4. Enter the name of your app, which is displayed to the user. The app name can be changed in later, if required..

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-inmeeting-doc-signing/register-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the App registration page on Azure AD Portal.":::

    5. Select **Multitenant** as the type of user account that can access your app.

    6. Select **Register**.
        A message pops up on the browser stating that the app was created.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-inmeeting-doc-signing/app-created-msg.png" alt-text="Register app on Azure AD Portal.":::

        The page with app ID and other configurations is displayed.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-inmeeting-doc-signing/app-created.png" alt-text="App registration is successful.":::

    7. Note and save the app ID from **Application (client) ID**. You'll need it for updating the Teams app manifest later.

    Your app is registered in Azure AD. You should now have the app ID for your app.

    ## To create a ngrok tunnel

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

     ```bash
     ngrok http https://localhost:44326 -host-header=localhost:44326
     ```

      The ngrok tunnel information appears.

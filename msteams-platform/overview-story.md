# From Ideas to a Teams App

Learn how apps enable you to deliver important and relevant information to your users within the Teams environment.

Take a look at this scenario:

As a developer, you want an efficient way to share critical and contextual information that addresses your users' needs—a typical user story. Relatable? Let’s explore how Microsoft Teams fits into this scenario.

## Delve Into App Ideation

When brainstorming your app, consider the entire user journey. The following steps help you analyze and define your app’s purpose and features:

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the user story as a developer at a travel agency, building apps for travelers." :::
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      #### Understand Your User

      Identify your target user and analyze how they interact with Teams. This step helps you tailor the user experience effectively.

      Relevant questions:
      - Do the users primarily use mobile clients?
      - How technically sophisticated are your primary users?
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      #### Understand the Problem

      Pinpoint the specific user problem you want your app to solve. This ensures your solution is both needed and valuable.

      Relevant questions:
      - What are the pros and cons of the users' current system?
      - Which issues or pain points do you want to address?
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you how to develop an app that sends weather forecast of the destination to customers." :::
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you that customers can know weather conditions and plan ahead." :::
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      #### List App Requirements and Benefits

      Define the features your app should have and how these features will resolve the identified problem. This step ensures that you deliver clear value to your users.

      Relevant questions:
      - Do users need regular updates without checking manually?
      - Does the solution require user authentication?
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      #### User-Centric Solution

      Design your app experience to be intuitive and targeted to your users' specific needs. Focus on enhancing usability and ensuring convenience.

      Relevant questions:
      - Should only registered users receive frequent updates?
      - What features will enhance the overall user experience?
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the customers are well-prepared for traveling!" :::
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

After defining your app's concept through ideation, you're ready to explore various Microsoft Teams features to build a complete solution.

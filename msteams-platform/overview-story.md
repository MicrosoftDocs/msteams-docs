      #### Understand your user

      To build an effective app, start by understanding your target users and how they interact within Teams. Reflect on the following:
      
      - **Do the users mostly use mobile clients?**  
        This helps determine if your app needs a mobile-optimized interface.
      - **How technically sophisticated are your primary users?**  
        Knowing this guides the level of complexity and technical features integrated into the app.

      #### Understand the problem

      Identify the core issue your users are experiencing. The problem needs to be clearly defined in order to provide a focused solution. Consider these questions:
      
      - **What are the pros and cons of the current system of your users?**  
        Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses to understand the real challenge.
      - **What issues do you want to address?**  
        Pinpoint areas where your app can offer improvements or new value.

      #### List app requirements and benefits

      Define the essential features for your app along with the anticipated benefits. This step ensures your solution meets user needs. Ask yourself:
      
      - **Do the users need current updates regularly without having to check manually?**  
        Consider integrating automated, real-time notifications.
      - **Do you need to authenticate users?**  
        Decide if adding a secure login or user verification process enhances the experience.

      #### User-centric solution

      Formulate a solution that is tailored around your users' needs. This involves designing an experience that matches their expectations and usage patterns. Reflect on:
      
      - **Should only registered users receive regular help?**  
        This might involve incorporating a user registration system.
      - **What features would be most convenient for user experience?**  
        Prioritize usability features like intuitive navigation and clear call-to-action elements.

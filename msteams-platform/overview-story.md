# From ideas to Teams app

Learn how apps let you help your users in the Teams environment.

Take a look at this scenario:

As a developer, you want a way to share important and relevant information to help your users. This scenario captures a typical user story. Relatable? But how does Teams fit into this scenario?

Let’s dig deeper into this story to understand the process.

## Delve into app ideation

The app ideation phase helps you understand the user, identify their problems, and list out the app requirements to deliver a tailored, user-centric solution. Below are the key steps to follow:

1. ### Understand Your User

   Gain insights into your target audience by determining how they interact with Teams, which guides your app design decisions.

   - **Key Considerations:**
     - Do the users primarily use mobile clients or desktop applications?
     - How technically sophisticated are the primary users?
     
   :::row:::
      :::column span="":::
         :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-01.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the user story as a developer at a travel agency, build apps for travelers." :::
      :::column-end:::
      :::column span="":::
         > #### Understand your user
         >
         > Knowing your user is crucial to determine the features and design of the app. Answering questions about the typical device used (mobile vs. desktop) and the user's technical background helps ensure your app is accessible and meets their needs.
      :::column-end:::
   :::row-end:::

2. ### Understand the Problem

   Identify the core issues your users face with the current system. This step ensures your solution directly addresses user pain points.

   - **Key Considerations:**
     - What are the current system’s strengths and weaknesses?
     - Which specific issues do you want your app to solve?
     
   :::row:::
      :::column span="":::
         > #### Understand the problem
         >
         > Focus on outlining the challenges users experience. By directing attention to the pros and cons of the existing system, you can pinpoint the exact areas your app should improve.
      :::column-end:::
      :::column span="":::
         :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-02.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you how to develop an app that sends weather forecast of the destination to customers." :::
      :::column-end:::
   :::row-end:::

3. ### List App Requirements and Benefits

   Define the features your app must include and the benefits it will provide to resolve the identified issues. This step is crucial for aligning development efforts with user needs.

   - **Key Considerations:**
     - Should the app provide updates regularly without the user needing to manually check?
     - Is there a need to incorporate user authentication for secure access?
     
   :::row:::
      :::column span="":::
         :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-03.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you that customers can know weather conditions and plan ahead." :::
      :::column-end:::
      :::column span="":::
         > #### List app requirements and benefits
         >
         > Create a comprehensive list of features that will address the user problem. Evaluating requirements like real-time updates and user authentication can help you design a robust solution.
      :::column-end:::
   :::row-end:::

4. ### User-Centric Solution

   Develop a solution that is tailored specifically to your user’s needs, ensuring the app experience is smooth and effective.

   - **Key Considerations:**
     - Should only registered users receive regular updates or support?
     - Which features will provide the most convenience for the end user?
     
   :::row:::
      :::column span="":::
         > #### User-centric solution
         >
         > Design an app experience that resonates with your target audience. Focus on incorporating features that not only solve the technical problem but also enhance usability and user satisfaction.
      :::column-end:::
      :::column span="":::
         :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/developer-scenario-04.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the customers are well-prepared for traveling!" :::
      :::column-end:::
   :::row-end:::

Practical Scenarios & Use Cases:

- When assessing "Understand Your User", consider a travel agency app where the primary audience is travelers using mobile devices. This insight guides the design toward mobile-focused user interfaces.
- In "Understand the Problem", imagine a scenario where users miss out on timely weather updates. This motivates incorporating push notifications in your app.
- For "List App Requirements and Benefits", envision incorporating secure authentication, especially when sensitive or personalized travel data is involved.
- In "User-Centric Solution", design a dashboard that caters exclusively to frequent flyers, ensuring registered users get priority updates and additional travel tips.

By aligning each step with practical, real-world needs, you ensure that your Teams app is both technically sound and highly relevant to your users.

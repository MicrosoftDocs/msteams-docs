# Microsoft Teams developer support and feedback

The Microsoft Teams product team responds to the developer community across several feedback and support channels.

## Platform Support and feedback channels

- **General questions about the Microsoft Teams developer platform:** Please send email to [Microsoft Teams developer support](mailto:microsoftteamsdev@microsoft.com). This email address is _not_ intended for comments or suggestions on non-platform-related features of Microsoft Teams. Furthermore, while we read all the email sent to this address, we do not reply to every one.

- **Programming questions:** We listen and respond on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/microsoft-teams). Follow the [guidance](http://stackoverflow.com/tour) about what makes a good question on Stack Overflow. Tag your question with `microsoft-teams` so that our team and the Microsoft Teams developer community can spot your question.

- **Documentation bugs:** If you find a bug in the Microsoft Teams developer documentation, open an [issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/msteams-docs/issues) on GitHub. Be sure to tell us which topic is factually incorrect or unclear. To help us fix the problem more quickly, quote the text to be changed.

- **Sample application bugs:** If you find a bug in one of our samples, open an issue on GitHub. Be sure to describe the steps to reproduce the bug.

- **Feature requests:** If our platform doesn't empower you to do what you need, please make your features suggestions on the [Microsoft Teams feedback portal on UserVoice](https://aka.ms/microsoftteamsplatformsuggestions).

- **Contributions:** We accept pull requests against the Microsoft Teams JavaScript library, documentation, and samples. If you'd like to contribute, please see the contributor's guide in each repo.

# OneNote Integration

OneNote integration helps with access to texts, graphics, and audio repositories. The advantages of the bundle of plugins are as follows:

* Include browsing notebooks, sections, and pages, where students work on assignments and teachers provide feedback on those assignments in OneNote.
* Combine digital binder for notes, assignments, and feedback for reference and review.
* Expand drafting capabilities beyond text and links, and extend mobile usage scenarios using digital pens, photo or video media, and co-author with groups.
* Include submission and feedback page for each assignment under the teacher's account. When such a page is saved within Moodle, a copy of the HTML and any associated pictures are packaged up in a zip file.

> [!NOTE]
> Submission or feedback events trigger OneNote creation with a section for each course the student is enrolled.

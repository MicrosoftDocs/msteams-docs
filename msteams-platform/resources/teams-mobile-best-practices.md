# Best practices for Teams mobile apps

If you want to increase the adoption of your Teams tab app on mobile devices, you must ensure a fast and responsive web experience on the Teams Android and iOS clients. Mobile devices contain limited processing power, network connectivity, and battery compared to desktops and laptops. This article outlines the best practices to optimize your Teams tab's web pages for the Teams mobile client.

## Use service workers to cache static assets

* Cache static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images to reduce network dependency.
* Use the stale-while-revalidate strategy to serve cached content quickly while fetching updated data in the background. You can also use this strategy to cache API responses that don't change frequently, such as configuration data.
* Avoid caching large assets to prevent unnecessary storage consumption on mobile devices.

### Sample app

Check out this [sample app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/tab-support-offline/nodejs) that makes use of a service worker to cache data and provide offline functionality.

## Minimize web page size

In areas with weak signal strength, mobile data networks can be slow and unstable, resulting in high latency. Hence, reducing the overall app package size and optimizing data transfers is critical. To reduce the page size, gather key performance metrics by running a performance audit using the **Performance** tab in dev tools. This helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your app.

### Run a performance audit

To run a performance audit, follow these steps:

1. [Enable dev tools](../tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md).

1. Select **inspect** under your app. This opens a new window.

1. Select the **Performance** tab. You can see a performance marker indicating the time it takes for your app from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to the `notifySuccess` call. This marker can be used to examine the network or local operations performed between `init()` and `notifySuccess`. In the following example, the **Timings** section shows that the app takes 2.20 seconds from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to `notifySuccess`, makes two calls to get the authorization token, and makes an API call that takes 1.5 seconds.

1. Select the **Lighthouse** tab. This tab provides meaningful insights into the app size and performance metrics.

1. Analyze page load time for mobile devices in LightHouse.

    Various diagnostics gets shown for the page along with a set of actionable insights. Aim to reduce the latencies flagged in this report.

1. Unused resources in the page size without providing any value. The **Coverage** tool allows one to see actual size and usage percentage of the resources on page.

    1. Enable Code Coverage from Tools.

    1. Start instrumentation of the code.

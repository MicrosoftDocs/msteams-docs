# Best practices for Teams mobile apps

 Mobile devices have limited processing power, network connectivity, and battery compared to desktops and laptops. If you want to increase the adoption of your Teams tab app on mobile devices, you must ensure a fast and responsive web experience on the Teams Android and iOS clients. This article outlines the best practices to optimize your Teams tab's webpages for the Teams mobile client.

## Use service workers to cache static assets

* Cache static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images to reduce network dependency.
* Use the stale-while-revalidate strategy to serve cached content quickly while fetching updated data in the background. You can also use this strategy to cache API responses that don't change frequently, such as configuration data.
* Avoid caching large assets to prevent unnecessary storage consumption on mobile devices.

### Sample app

Check out this [sample app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/tab-support-offline/nodejs) that makes use of a service worker to cache data and provide offline functionality.

## Minimize webpage size

In areas with weak signal strength, mobile data network can be slow and unstable, resulting in high latency. Hence, reducing the overall app package size and optimizing data transfers is critical. To reduce the page size, gather key performance metrics by running a performance audit using the **Performance** tab in dev tools. The performance audit helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your app.

### Performance audit

To run a performance audit, follow these steps:

1. [Enable dev tools](../tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md#access-devtools-from-teams-android-client).

1. Open dev tools and select **inspect** under your app. A new window opens.

1. Select the **Performance** tab. You can see a performance marker indicating the time it takes for your app from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to the `notifySuccess` call. You can use this marker to examine the network or local operations performed between `init()` and `notifySuccess`.

    In the following example, the **Timings** section shows that the app takes 2.20 seconds from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to `notifySuccess`, makes two calls to get an authorization token, and makes a third API call that takes 1.5 seconds.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-performance.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the performance tab in dev tools." lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-performance-full.png":::

1. Select the **Lighthouse** tab. This tab provides insights into the app size and performance metrics.

    1. Under **Device**, ensure that you select **Mobile**.

    1. Select **Analyze page load**.

        :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-lighthouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the lighthouse tab under dev tools." lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-lighthouse.png":::

        The report shows various diagnostics for your app's webpage and a set of actionable insights to decrease page load. Ensure that you take the required steps to reduce the latencies flagged in this report.

1. Select the **Coverage** tab. Your webpage might contain unused resources that don't provide any value to the functionality of the app. This tab allows you to see actual size and usage percentage of the resources on the webpage.

    1. If you can't find it in the home page of dev tools, go to **More tools** > **Coverage**.

        :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/enable-coverage-tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to enable coverage tools in dev tools." lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/enable-coverage-tools.png":::

    1. You can use the report to remove unused code or resources.

## Calculate performance metrics for apps

Leverage the self-serve, lightweight **Performance Report tool** (or Perf tool) to evaluate efficiency of your web and tab apps on mobile. This tool runs seamlessly on both Android and iOS, and with real-time performance metrics mapped against industry benchmarks, ensuring a superior user experience. It also enables you to implement Teams-specific best practices into your app directly from your mobile.

The steps involved are:

1. [Generate performance metrics report](#generate-performance-metrics-report)
1. [Access performance metrics report](#access-performance-metrics-report)
1. [Analyze performance metrics report](#analyze-performance-metrics-report)

> [!NOTE]
>
> For accurate latency calculation, ensure that your app calls the `notifySuccess()` API after it's fully loaded.

### Generate performance metrics report

To generate performance metrics via **Performance Report tool** for your mobile app, follow these steps:

1. On your Teams mobile app, go to **Settings** > **About** > **Developer preview** and toggle the switch to enable **Developer preview**.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/self-serve-lightweight-developer-preview-toggle.jpg" alt-text="screenshot shows the Developer Preview toggle in Teams settings" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/self-serve-lightweight-developer-preview-toggle.jpg":::

1. Navigate to **Apps** section.

1. Open the app you want to audit, wait for it to load.

1. To generate the report
    * On Android app:

         1. Select the kebab :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/kebab-icon.jpg" border="false"::: menu.

         1. Select **Generate Performance Report**.

             :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/android-entry-point.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot shows the entry point for Android audit tool" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/android-entry-point.jpg":::

    * On iOS app, select the audit app performance :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/generate-report-icon.png" border="false"::: icon which appears on the title bar.

    An interim page appears while the report is being generated for both Android and iOS.

1. After the report is generated, access it from the bottom sheet that appears with the html performance report.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/performance-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the static html performance report" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/performance-report.png":::

> [!NOTE]
>
> * There's no restriction on the number of times that a report can be generated for an app.
> * The generated report is a static html page whose contents remain unchanged throughout the journey. A new report is generated only when you repeat the report generation process.
> * Refreshing or navigating away interrupts the process.
> * If the report isn't generated, a **Performance metrics could not be calculated. Please refresh or try again.** error message appears.

### Access performance metrics report

The report provides insights using browser and operating system-level APIs, along with Teams-specific performance markers.

On an Android mobile, you can access the report from the following options on the bottom sheet:

* **Open Report**: Opens the report in a new browser window.
* **Share report**: Opens the device’s options for sharing outside Teams.
* **Forward in Teams**: Opens the device’s share menu for sharing in Teams.
* **Download**: Downloads the report in the device’s local storage.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/performance-report-success-bottom-sheet.png" alt-text="report-success-bottom-sheet" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/performance-report-success-bottom-sheet.png":::

On an iOS mobile, **Forward in Teams** option is not available.

### Analyze performance metrics report

The performance metrics report contains the following metrics.

| Metric | Description | System response/Action required  |
|----------- |-------------| ------ |
|**Latency** | This metric measures the (approximate) time taken by your Teams mobile app to load.| <ul><li/> **If your app uses `notifySuccess()`**: In this section, the app latency is calculated and displayed at the top. A timeline subsequently displays the end time for each API call during app load. <br> :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/notify-success-called.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot shows the notification for apps calling notifySuccess()" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/notify-success-called.jpg"::: <br> <li/> **If your app doesn't use `notifySuccess()`**: Latency can’t be calculated, and a message with an embedded link prompts you to use the `notifySuccess()`API for your app. :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/latency-not-calculated.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the error message for apps not calling notifySuccess()" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/latency-not-calculated.png":::</ul>|
|**Caching (Service Worker)** | This metric shows if [service worker](#use-service-workers-to-cache-static-assets) is implemented as a local caching mechanism*.| If service worker is implemented, **Available** is displayed in green, else **Not Available** is displayed in red. <br> When service worker is **Not Available**, use the link displayed in the report to proceed with implementation.<br> :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/app-audit-report-caching.png" alt-text="screenshot shows caching status for Android" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/app-audit-report-caching.png"::: |
| **App Package** | This metric indicates the total size occupied by the javascript file bundle of the mobile app.| Ideal package size is 1 MB. If package size exceeds the ideal size of 1 MB, the size is displayed in red. <br> Click **Check bundle files**. <br> :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/app-audit-report-app-package.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows ideal app package size with link to relevant documentation" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/app-audit-report-app-package.png"::: <br> A detailed list of files affecting bundle size appears, in descending order of file size.<br> :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/files-affecting-bundle-size.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the files affecting bundle size" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/files-affecting-bundle-size.png"::: <br> <br> Use [service worker](#use-service-workers-to-cache-static-assets) and other [best practices](#best-practices-for-teams-mobile-apps) to optimize your app's performance.|
| **Content Paint Metrics** | This metric indicates all relevant content paint metrics (and their values) for your mobile app. | Content paint metrics show how fast visual elements appear while your app page loads.

# Best practices for Teams mobile apps

 Mobile devices have limited processing power, network connectivity, and battery compared to desktops and laptops. If you want to increase the adoption of your Teams tab app on mobile devices, you must ensure a fast and responsive web experience on the Teams Android and iOS clients. This article outlines the best practices to optimize your Teams tab's webpages for the Teams mobile client.

## Use service workers to cache static assets

* Cache static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images to reduce network dependency.
* Use the stale-while-revalidate strategy to serve cached content quickly while fetching updated data in the background. You can also use this strategy to cache API responses that don't change frequently, such as configuration data.
* Avoid caching large assets to prevent unnecessary storage consumption on mobile devices.

### Sample app

Check out this [sample app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/tab-support-offline/nodejs) that makes use of a service worker to cache data and provide offline functionality.

## Minimize webpage size

In areas with weak signal strength, mobile data network can be slow and unstable, resulting in high latency. Hence, reducing the overall app package size and optimizing data transfers is critical. To reduce the page size, gather key performance metrics by running a performance audit using the **Performance** tab in dev tools. The performance audit helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your app.

### Performance audit

To run a performance audit, follow these steps:

1. [Enable dev tools](../tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md#access-devtools-from-teams-android-client).

1. Open dev tools and select **inspect** under your app. A new window opens.

1. Select the **Performance** tab. You can see a performance marker indicating the time it takes for your app from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to the `notifySuccess` call. You can use this marker to examine the network or local operations performed between `init()` and `notifySuccess`.

    In the following example, the **Timings** section shows that the app takes 2.20 seconds from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to `notifySuccess`, makes two calls to get an authorization token, and makes a third API call that takes 1.5 seconds.

1. Select the **Lighthouse** tab. This tab provides insights into the app size and performance metrics.

    1. Under **Device**, ensure that you select **Mobile**.

    1. Select **Analyze page load**.

        The report shows various diagnostics for your app's webpage and a set of actionable insights to decrease page load. Ensure that you take the required steps to reduce the latencies flagged in this report.

1. Select the **Coverage** tab. Your webpage might contain unused resources that don't provide any value to the functionality of the app. This tab allows you to see actual size and usage percentage of the resources on the webpage.

    1. If you can't find it in the home page of dev tools, go to **More tools** > **Coverage**.

        :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/enable-coverage-tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to enable coverage tools in dev tools." lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/enable-coverage-tools.png":::

    1. You can use the report to remove unused code or resources.

## Calculate performance metrics for apps

Monitoring and analytics are crucial for optimizing app performance; and identifying existing apps with low performance to get them to adapt best practices is the ideal way forward. With the new **Self-Serve Lightweight Audit Tool** developers can now assess and optimize app performance, especially on mobile platforms for Android and iOS. This tool is accessible through the Developer Preview toggle and provides simple, integrated real-time insights using browser and OS-level APIs, along with Teams-specific performance markers.

### Generating the report

To generate the performance metrics for an app, follow these steps:

1. On your Teams client, go to **Settings** > **About** > **Developer Preview** and toggle the switch to enable Developer Preview.

1. Navigate to **Apps** section.

1. Select the app you want to audit. The app home page opens.

1. To trigger report generation
    * On an Android app landing page:

         1. Select the three-dot menu on the top right corner and select **Audit app performance**. A popup appears as shown in the following figure.

         1. Click **Generate Performance Report**.

    * On an iOS app landing page, select the audit app performance icon that appears next to the bot icon, as shown in the following figure.

    A bottom sheet appears as shown in the following figure if the report is generated successfully (in html format).

    If the report is not generated, a **Performance metrics could not be calculated. Please refresh or try again** message appears.

### Accessing the report

To access the report from the bottom sheet, click **Open report**. The generated report can be opened in a new browser window or an html viewer.

You will also be able to download, share or forward the report to Teams as allowed by your device specifications (refer preceding figure).

> [NOTE!]
> An interim page appears while the report is being generated. Do not refresh or navigate away, as this will interrupt the process.
> There is no restriction on the number of times that a report can be generated for an app.

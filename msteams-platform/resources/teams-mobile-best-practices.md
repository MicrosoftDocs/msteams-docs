# Best practices for Teams mobile apps

 Mobile devices have limited processing power, network connectivity, and battery compared to desktops and laptops. If you want to increase the adoption of your Teams tab app on mobile devices, you must ensure a fast and responsive web experience on the Teams Android and iOS clients. This article outlines the best practices to optimize your Teams tab's webpages for the Teams mobile client.

## Use service workers to cache static assets

* Cache static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images to reduce network dependency.
* Use the stale-while-revalidate strategy to serve cached content quickly while fetching updated data in the background. You can also use this strategy to cache API responses that don't change frequently, such as configuration data.
* Avoid caching large assets to prevent unnecessary storage consumption on mobile devices.

### Sample app

Check out this [sample app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/tab-support-offline/nodejs) that makes use of a service worker to cache data and provide offline functionality.

## Minimize webpage size

In areas with weak signal strength, mobile data network can be slow and unstable, resulting in high latency. Hence, reducing the overall app package size and optimizing data transfers is critical. To reduce the page size, gather key performance metrics by running a performance audit using the **Performance** tab in dev tools. The performance audit helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement in your app.

### Performance audit

To run a performance audit, follow these steps:

1. [Enable dev tools](../tabs/how-to/developer-tools.md#access-devtools-from-teams-android-client).

1. Open dev tools and select **inspect** under your app. A new window opens.

1. Select the **Performance** tab. You can see a performance marker indicating the time it takes for your app from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to the `notifySuccess` call. You can use this marker to examine the network or local operations performed between `init()` and `notifySuccess`.

    In the following example, the **Timings** section shows that the app takes 2.20 seconds from Teams JavaScript SDK initialization to `notifySuccess`, makes two calls to get an authorization token, and makes a third API call that takes 1.5 seconds.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-performance.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the performance tab in dev tools." lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-performance-full.png":::

1. Select the **Lighthouse** tab. This tab provides insights into the app size and performance metrics.

    1. Under **Device**, ensure that you select **Mobile**.

    1. Select **Analyze page load**.

        :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-lighthouse.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the lighthouse tab under dev tools." lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/dev-tools-lighthouse.png":::

        The report shows various diagnostics for your app's webpage and a set of actionable insights to decrease page load. Ensure that you take the required steps to reduce the latencies flagged in this report.

1. Select the **Coverage** tab. Your webpage might contain unused resources that don't provide any value to the functionality of the app. This tab allows you to see actual size and usage percentage of the resources on the webpage.

    1. If you can't find it in the home page of dev tools, go to **More tools** > **Coverage**.

        :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/enable-coverage-tools.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to enable coverage tools in dev tools." lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/enable-coverage-tools.png":::

    1. You can use the report to remove unused code or resources.

## Calculate performance metrics for apps

Identifying existing apps with low performance to drive them to adapt best practices is crucial for improving app performance. The **Self-Serve Lightweight Audit Tool** allows you to analyze and optimize app performance on Android and iOS mobile platforms.

The steps involved are:

1. [Generate performance metrics report](#generate-performance-metrics-report)
1. [Access performance metrics report](#access-performance-metrics-report)
1. [Analyze performance metrics report](#analyze-performance-metrics-report)

> [!NOTE]
>
> For accurate latency calculation, ensure that your app calls the `notifySuccess()` API after it's fully loaded.

### Generate performance metrics report

To generate performance metrics via **Self-Serve Lightweight Audit Tool** for your mobile app, follow these steps:

1. On your Teams app, go to **Settings** > **About** > **Developer preview** and toggle the switch to enable **Developer preview**.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/self-serve-lightweight-developer-preview-toggle.jpg" alt-text="screenshot shows the Developer Preview toggle in Teams settings" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/self-serve-lightweight-developer-preview-toggle.jpg":::

1. Navigate to **Apps** section.

1. Select the app you want to audit. The app home page appears.

1. To generate the report
    * On Android app:

         1. Select the kebab :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/kebab-icon.jpg" border="false"::: menu.

         1. Select **Generate Performance Report**.

             :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/android-entry-point.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot shows the entry point for Android audit tool" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/android-entry-point.jpg":::

    * On iOS app, select the audit app performance :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/generate-report-icon.png" border="false"::: icon.

    An interim page appears while the report is being generated for both Android and iOS.

1. After the report is generated, access it from the bottom sheet that appears with the html performance report.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/performance-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the static html performance report" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/performance-report.png":::

> [!NOTE]
>
> * There's no restriction on the number of times that a report can be generated for an app.
> * The generated report is a static html page whose contents remain unchanged throughout the journey. A new report is generated only when you repeat the report generation process.
> * Refreshing or navigating away interrupts the process.
> * If the report isn't generated, a **Performance metrics could not be calculated. Please refresh or try again.** message appears.

### Access performance metrics report

The report provides simple, integrated real-time insights using browser and operating system-level APIs, along with Teams-specific performance markers.

You can access the report from the following options on the bottom sheet:

* **Open Report**: Opens the report in a new browser window.
* **Share report**: Opens the device’s options for sharing outside Teams.
* **Forward in Teams**: Opens the device’s share menu for sharing in Teams.
* **Download**: Downloads the report in the device’s local storage.

### Analyze performance metrics report

The performance metrics report contains the following metrics.

Section name | Description | Action |
|----------- |-------------| ------ |
| **Latency** | Measures the (approximate) time taken by your app to load.| <ul><li/> **For apps that call `notifySuccess()`**: The overall latency number appears on top, followed by a sequential timeline indicating end time for each API call on app load. :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/notify-success-called.jpg" alt-text="Screenshot shows the notification for apps calling notifySuccess()" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/notify-success-called.jpg"::: <br> <br> <li/> **For apps that don’t call `notifySuccess()`**: Latency can’t be calculated. Either a dash or question mark appears in place of the overall latency number. An error message appears, with the nudge to use `notifysuccess()` API call.:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/latency-not-calculated.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the error message for apps not calling notifySuccess()" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/latency-not-calculated.png":::</ul>|
| **Caching (Service Worker)** | Indicates [service worker](#use-service-workers-to-cache-static-assets) (SW) is enabled as a local caching mechanism. The values are **Available** (in green) and **Not Available** (in red).| If SW is not enabled, the report provides a link to relevant documentation to help you implement it in your app. <br> :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/app-audit-report-caching.png" alt-text="screenshot shows caching status for Android" lightbox="../assets/images/tabs/lightweight-audit-tool/app-audit-report-caching.png"::: |

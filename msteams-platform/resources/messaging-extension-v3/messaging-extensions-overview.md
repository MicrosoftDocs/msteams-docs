# Develop messaging extensions for Microsoft Teams

[!include[v3-to-v4-SDK-pointer](~/includes/v3-to-v4-pointer-me.md)]

Messaging extensions are a powerful way for users to engage with your app from Microsoft Teams. With this capability, users can query or post information to and from your service and post that information, in the form of cards, right into a message.

Messaging extensions appear along the bottom of the compose box. A few are built in, such as Emoji, Giphy, and Sticker. Choose the **More Options** (**&#8943;**) button to see other messaging extensions, including those you add from the app gallery or upload yourself.

How would you use messaging extensions? Here are a few possibilities:

* Work items and bugs
* Customer support tickets
* Usage charts and reports
* Images and media content
* Sales opportunities and leads

## Types of messaging extensions

There's primarily two kinds of messaging extensions you can create for Teams today. The following topics will guide you through the process of creating them:

* [Search based messaging extensions](~/resources/messaging-extension-v3/search-extensions.md): Query your service for information and insert that into a message. Example: Lookup a work item
* [Action-based messaging extensions](~/resources/messaging-extension-v3/create-extensions.md): Collect information from the user and post to a 3rd party service. Example: Create a work item

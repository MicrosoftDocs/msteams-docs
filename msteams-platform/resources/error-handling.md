The same behavior is observed on mobile as well. <br><br> **Source:** [View](https://github.com/officedev/microsoft-teams-library-js/issues/1487) | The getTabInstances API isn't implemented on mobile and its performance is poor. Don't use it, as it gets deprecated. Instead, use the Graph APIs to know what tabs are pinned in a given chat or channel. The links to these APIs are [Add tab to chat](/graph/api/chat-post-tabs) and [List tabs in channel](/graph/api/channel-list-tabs). Using these APIs may require extra permissions on the app registration.

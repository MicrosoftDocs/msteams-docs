# Cards in bot conversations

[!include[v3-to-v4-SDK-pointer](~/includes/v3-to-v4-pointer-bots.md)]

A *card* is a user-interface (UI) container for short or related pieces of information. Cards can have multiple properties and attachments. Teams support cards in bots, connectors and messaging extensions. See [Cards](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards.md) for an overview of what cards are and how Teams uses them.

Bots use cards as part of conversations. See [Bot Conversations](~/resources/bot-v3/bot-conversations/bots-conversations.md) for the details.

The [Teams Card Reference](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md) lists all cards supported by bots and discusses how to use them.

[Card actions](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions.md) lists all actions supported by cards and discusses how to use them.

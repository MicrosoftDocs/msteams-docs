# Public developer preview app manifest schema

For information on how to enable developer preview, see [public developer preview for Microsoft Teams](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you aren't using developer preview features, including running [Teams personal tabs and message extensions in Outlook and Microsoft 365 app](../../m365-apps/overview.md), use the [app manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md) (previously called Teams app manifest) for generally available (GA) features instead.

The app manifest describes how the app integrates into the Microsoft Teams platform. Your app manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [`https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/vDevPreview/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json`](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/vDevPreview/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json).

        ]
    }
}
```

The schema defines the following properties:

## $schema

*Optional, but recommended* &ndash; String

The `https://` URL referencing the JSON Schema for the app manifest.

## manifestVersion

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the app manifest schema this manifest is using.

## version

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the specific app. If you update something in your app manifest, the version must be incremented as well. This way, when the new app manifest is installed, it overwrites the existing one and the user gets the new functionality. If this app was submitted to the Microsoft Teams Store, the new app manifest has to be resubmitted and revalidated. Then, users of this app will get the new updated app manifest automatically in a few hours, after it's approved.

If the app requested permissions change, users are prompted to upgrade and re-consent to the app.

This version string must follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

> [!NOTE]
> If your app includes an Office Add-in, each segment of the version string is limited to a maximum of five digits. The semver standard's pre-release and metadata version string extensions aren't supported.

## id

**Required** &ndash; Microsoft app ID

The unique Microsoft-generated identifier for this app. The format of the ID is GUID. If you've registered a bot through Microsoft Bot Framework, or your tab's web app already signs in with Microsoft, then you might already have an ID and must enter it here. Otherwise, you must generate a new ID at the Microsoft Application Registration Portal ([My Applications](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)), enter it here, and then reuse it when you [add a bot](~/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams.md).

## developer

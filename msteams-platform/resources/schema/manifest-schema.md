# App manifest schema

The app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) describes how your app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product. Your app manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [`https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.17/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json`](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.17/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json). Previous versions 1.0, 1.1,...,1.16, and the current version is 1.17 are each supported (using "v1.x" in the URL).
For more information on the changes made in each version, see [app manifest change log](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/releases) and for previous versions, see [app manifest versions](https://github.com/microsoft/json-schemas/tree/main/teams).

The following table lists TeamsJS version and app manifest versions as per different app scenarios:

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/teamjs-version-details.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If your Teams app is using the app manifest version 1.13 or later, ensure that your app meets the criteria to [extend your app to run across Microsoft 365 or Outlook](../../m365-apps/extend-m365-teams-personal-tab.md).

The following is the sample app manifest schema:

}
```

The schema defines the following properties:

## $schema

Optional, but recommended &ndash; String

The https:// URL referencing the JSON Schema for the app manifest.

## manifestVersion

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the app manifest schema that this manifest is using. Use `1.13` to enable Teams app support in Outlook and Microsoft 365 app; use `1.12` (or earlier) for Teams-only apps.

## version

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of a specific app. When you update something in your app manifest, the version must be incremented too. This way, when the new app manifest is installed, it overwrites the existing one and the user receives the new functionality. When this app was submitted to the Microsoft Teams Store, the new app manifest must be resubmitted and revalidated. The app users receive the new updated app manifest automatically within few hours after the app manifest is approved.

If the app requests for permissions change, the users are prompted to upgrade and reconsent to the app.

This version string must follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

> [!NOTE]
> If your app includes an Office Add-in, each segment of the version string is limited to a maximum of five digits. The semver standard's pre-release and metadata version string extensions aren't supported.

## ID

**Required** &ndash; Microsoft app ID

The ID is a unique Microsoft-generated identifier for the app. The format of the ID is GUID. You have an ID if your bot is registered through the Microsoft Bot Framework. You have an ID if your tab's web app already signs in with Microsoft. You must enter the ID here. Otherwise, you must generate a new ID at the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://aka.ms/appregistrations). Use the same ID if you add a bot.

The ID stored in Teams Admin Center is the **External App ID** and it's visible as **ExternalID** on the traces.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are submitting an update to your existing app in AppSource, the ID in your app manifest must not be modified.

## developer

**Required** &ndash; Object

Specifies information about your company. For apps submitted to the Teams Store, these values must match the information in your Teams Store listing. For more information, see the [Teams Store publishing guidelines](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/publish.md). Developer name helps improve your app discoverability in the Teams Store.

|Name|Type| Maximum size | Required | Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`name`|String|32 characters|✔️|The display name for the developer.|
|`websiteUrl`|String|2048 characters|✔️|The https:// URL to the developer's website. This link must take users to your company or product-specific landing page.|
|`privacyUrl`|String|2048 characters|✔️|The https:// URL to the developer's privacy policy.|
|`termsOfUseUrl`|String|2048 characters|✔️|The https:// URL to the developer's terms of use.|
|`mpnId`|String|10 characters| |**Optional** The Microsoft Partner Network ID that identifies the partner organization building the app.|

## name

**Required** &ndash; Object

The name of your app experience, displayed to users in the Teams experience. For apps submitted to AppSource, these values must match the information in your AppSource entry. The values of `short` and `full` must be different. App name helps improve your app discoverability in the Teams Store.

|Name|Type| Maximum size | Required | Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`short`|String|30 characters|✔️|The short display name for the app. Use `short` property where the space is limited, such as the app header.|
|`full`|String|100 characters|✔️|The full name of the app, used if the full app name exceeds 30 characters. Use `full` property where there's more space, such as the app catalog or the app details page.|

> [!NOTE]
>
> * In the app manifest v1.17 or later the `full` property is required and for app manifest v1.16 or earlier it isn't required.
> * The `short` property is used across all UI surfaces.

## description

**Required** &ndash; Object

Describes your app to users. For apps submitted to AppSource, these values must match the information in your AppSource entry. App description helps improve your app discoverability in the Teams Store.

Ensure that your description describes your experience and helps potential customers understand what your experience does. You must note in the full description, if an external account is required for use. The values of `short` and `full` must be different. Your short description can't be repeated within the long description and must not include any other app name.

|Name| Type | Maximum size | Required | Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`short`|String|80 characters|✔️|A short description of your app experience, used when space is limited.|
|`full`|String|4000 characters|✔️|The full description of your app.|

## localizationInfo

**Optional** &ndash; Object

Changing these permissions during app update, causes your users to repeat the consent process after they run the updated app. For more information, see [Updating your app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/post-publish/overview.md).

Do **not** include the domains of identity providers you want to support in your app. For example, to authenticate using a Google ID, it's required to redirect to accounts.google.com, however, you must not include accounts.google.com in `validDomains[]`.

Teams apps that require their own SharePoint URLs to function well, includes "{teamsitedomain}" in their valid domain list.

>
> * If a subdomain segment includes a wildcard, it must be the only character in the segment.

If your app doesn't have an app manifest file, you need to create it.

To create an app manifest file:

1. Use the [sample app manifest schema](#sample-app-manifest) to create a .json file.
1. Save it in the root of your project folder as `manifest.json`.

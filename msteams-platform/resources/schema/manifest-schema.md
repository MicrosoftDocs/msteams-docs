# App manifest

The app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) describes how your app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product. Your app manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.23/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.23/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json). Previous versions 1.0, 1.1,...,1.22, and the current version is 1.23 are each supported (using "v1.x" in the URL). Version 1.18 isn't available.
For more information on the changes made in each version, see [app manifest change log](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/releases) and for previous versions, see [app manifest versions](https://github.com/microsoft/json-schemas/tree/main/teams).

The following table lists TeamsJS version and app manifest versions as per different app scenarios:

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/teamjs-version-details.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If your Teams app is using the app manifest version 1.13 or later, ensure that your app meets the criteria to [extend your app to run across Microsoft 365 or Outlook](../../m365-apps/extend-m365-teams-personal-tab.md).

The following is the sample app manifest schema:

    }
}
```

The schema defines the following properties:

## $schema

Optional, but recommended &ndash; String

The https:// URL referencing the JSON Schema for the app manifest.

## manifestVersion

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the app manifest schema that this manifest is using. Use `1.13` to enable Teams app support in Outlook and Microsoft 365 app; use `1.12` (or earlier) for Teams-only apps.

## version

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of a specific app. When you update something in your app manifest, the version must be incremented too. This way, when the new app manifest is installed, it overwrites the existing one and the user receives the new functionality. When this app was submitted to the Microsoft Teams Store, the new app manifest must be resubmitted and revalidated. The app users receive the new updated app manifest automatically within few hours after the app manifest is approved.

If the app requests for permissions change, the users are prompted to upgrade and reconsent to the app.

This version string must follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

> [!NOTE]
> If your app includes an Office Add-in, each segment of the version string is limited to a maximum of five digits. The semver standard's pre-release and metadata version string extensions aren't supported.

## ID

**Required** &ndash; Microsoft app ID

The ID is a unique Microsoft-generated identifier for the app. The format of the ID is GUID. You have an ID if your bot is registered through the Microsoft Bot Framework. You have an ID if your tab's web app already signs in with Microsoft. You must enter the ID here.

An array of `string`, which specifies which permissions the app requests, which let end users know how the extension does. The following options are non-exclusive:

* `identity` &emsp; Requires user identity information.
* `messageTeamMembers` &emsp; Requires permission to send direct messages to team members.

Changing these permissions during app update, causes your users to repeat the consent process after they run the updated app. For more information, see [Updating your app](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/post-publish/overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Permissions are deprecated now.

## devicePermissions

**Optional** &ndash; Array of enum

Allows a maximum 5 array items. Provides the native features on a user's device that your app requests access to. Options are:

* `geolocation`
* `media`
* `notifications`
* `midi`
* `openExternal`

## validDomains

**Optional** (except **Required** where noted) &ndash; Array of strings

A list of valid domains for websites the app expects to load within the Teams client. Domain listings can include wildcards, for example, `*.example.com`. The valid domain matches exactly one segment of the domain; if you need to match `a.b.example.com` then use `*.*.example.com`. If your tab configuration or content UI navigates to any other domain other than tab configuration, that domain must be specified here.

Do **not** include the domains of identity providers you want to support in your app. For example, to authenticate using a Google ID, it's required to redirect to accounts.google.com, however, you must not include accounts.google.com in `validDomains[]`.

Teams apps that require their own SharePoint URLs to function well, includes "{teamsitedomain}" in their valid domain list.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't add domains that are outside your control, either directly or through wildcards (*). For example,***.yoursite.com** is valid, but ***.onmicrosoft.com** isn't valid as it isn't under your control.
>
> When using wildcards, the following rules apply:
>
> * If a subdomain segment includes a wildcard, it must be the only character in the segment.
> * Any segment preceding a wildcard segment must also be a wildcard segment.
>
> For example, *\*.\*.domain.com* is valid, but *foo.\*.myteam.domain.com* is not valid.

The object is an array with all elements of the type `string`. The maximum item of the object is 16 and maximum length is 2048 characters.

## webApplicationInfo

| result | Array of `extensionResult` | | ✔️ | Object that defines the type of information that is returned by the function. |
| `stream` | boolean | | | If true, the function can output repeatedly to the cell even when invoked only once. This option is useful for rapidly-changing data sources, such as a stock price. The function should have no return statement. Instead, the result value is passed as the argument of the `StreamingInvocation.setResult` callback function. |
| `volatile` | boolean | | | If true, the function recalculates each time Excel recalculates, instead of only when the formula's dependent values have changed. A function can't use both the stream and volatile properties. If the stream and volatile properties are both set to true, the volatile property will be ignored. <br> Default value: `False`. |
| `cancelable` | boolean | | | If true, Excel calls the CancelableInvocation handler whenever the user takes an action that has the effect of canceling the function; for example, manually triggering recalculation or editing a cell that is referenced by the function. Cancelable functions are typically only used for asynchronous functions that return a single result and need to handle the cancellation of a request for data. A function can't use both the stream and cancelable properties. <br> Default value: `False`. |
| `requiresAddress` | boolean | | | If true, your custom function can access the address of the cell that invoked it. The address property of the invocation parameter contains the address of the cell that invoked your custom function. A function can't use both the stream and requiresAddress properties. <br> Default value: `False`. |
| `requiresParameterAddress` | boolean | | | If true, your custom function can access the addresses of the function's input parameters. This property must be used in combination with the dimensionality property of the result object, and dimensionality must be set to matrix. <br> Default value: `False`. |

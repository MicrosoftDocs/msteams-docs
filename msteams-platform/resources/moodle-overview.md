# Moodle learning management system

 Moodle is one of the largest open-source learning managing system (LMS), which provides unique remote learning experience powered with secured privacy services. Moodle LMS integrates with Microsoft Teams to provide the following services:

* Audio or video calls.
* Chat with students.
* Courses and activity.
* Badges and rewards.
* Analytical insights.

<!-- [Moodle](https://moodle.com/about/) is the world’s largest open-source learning management system (LMS). With greater than 30 years of experience in remote learning, it has attracted around 300 million users worldwide with its rich set of hosted and cloud-based services.

## Moodle LMS accessibility

Moodle LMS helps users access the following apps:

* **Microsoft 365 plugins**: The Microsoft 365 plugins are designed to ensure integration between Moodle sites and Teams. These plugins can be used independently, or in partnership to achieve distinct user requirements. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 plugins](m365-plugins/m365-plugins-overview.md).

* **Partner apps for Moodle**: All the partner set of apps for Moodle and Teams are available in Microsoft Store. For more information, see [Partner apps for Moodle](partner-apps-for-moodle.md).

## User requirement scenarios

The following scenarios describe the accelerated learning potential combining Microsoft's cloud services with Moodle's courses:

* **Facilitate hybrid remote meetings**: Teams meetings and extensibility services allow faculty to present in-person and remotely with students. For students it's mandatory to have access to shared views, apps, and polls for remote meetings. The follow-up tasks provide for multi-language transcription and audio or video course recordings. Teams and Moodle work together to share roosters, activities, and tasks.

* **Personalize meeting panels**: Create unique collaborative learning experiences using Teams Graph API endpoints. For other additional plans or projects, users can interview all new recruits and categorize the results using custom polls. There's facility to share quizzes directly in Teams while pushing updates to the Moodle site asynchronously.

* **Automate facility**: To set up automated facilities for institutions when a new student joins, the user can add Moodle course, send an Adaptive Card to the student with relevant links and suggest key reading course materials. Teams custom connector for Moodle helps to create Moodle calendar event each time a course meeting is scheduled.

* **Build Citizen developer apps**: To develop new custom apps for school, which are easy to create and help optimize learning. The app also provides easy-to-use transactional activities for students and faculty.

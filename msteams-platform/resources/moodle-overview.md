## Scenarios

The scenarios provided are examples of accelerated learning potential combining Microsoft's cloud services with Moodle's courses:

* **Facilitate hybrid remote meetings**: With Teams meetings and extensibility options, instructors can seamlessly present in-person and remotely while it is mandatory for students to have access to shared views, apps, and polls. For enhanced follow-up task, you must include the option for multi-language transcription and audio or video course recordings. Teams and Moodle are game changers, working together to share roosters, activities, and tasks.

* **Personalize meeting panels and apps**: You can use Teams Graph API endpoints to create unique collaborative learning experiences. For special initiatives in school such as, hackathon, users can interview all freshman students by categorizing submissions using custom polls and share quizzes directly in Teams while pushing updates to the Moodle portal asynchronously.

* **Automations and workflow**: To set up automation for institution when a new student joins, the user can add Moodle course, send an Adaptive Card to the student with relevant links and suggest key reading  course materials. With Teams along with custom connector for Moodle, the user can create a Moodle calendar event each time a course meeting is scheduled.

* **Citizen developer apps**: Introduce new custom apps as differentiators for school. Simple apps that help to optimize learning can be created in days, and within hours. Envision for Teams with special event schedules, shuttle bookings, library books, mentors, and various other services. The user can also create showcase value or provide easy-to-use transactional activities for students and teachers.

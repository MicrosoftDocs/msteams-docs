# Features in the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams

The developer preview includes the following new features:

## Personal apps (static tabs and 1-1 bots) enabled on mobile

Installed personal apps (static tabs and 1-1 bots) are now available in the app tray on mobile devices. See [Design guidelines for mobile](~/resources/design/framework/tabs-mobile.md) for design guidance. Apps can only be installed from a desktop or web client, and can take up to 24 hours to be available on mobile after installation.

## Calls and online meeting bots

With the addition of [Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings](/graph/api/resources/calls-api-overview), Microsoft Teams apps can now interact with users in rich ways using voice and video. These APIs allow you to add new app features such as interactive voice response (IVR), call control, and access to real-time audio and/or video streams for calls and meetings, including desktop and app sharing.

We've added a new section on how to create and develop calls and online meetings bots, starting with the [overview](~/concepts/calls-and-meetings/calls-meetings-bots-overview.md).

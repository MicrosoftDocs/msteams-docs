## Prerequisites

Following are the prerequisites to install Moodle:

* Moodle administrator credentials.

* Microsoft Entra administrator credentials.

* An Azure subscription where you can create new resources.

## Install the Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugins

Moodle integration in Microsoft Teams is powered by the open-source [Microsoft 365 Moodle plugins set](https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=set&id=72).

### Requisite applications and plugins

Ensure to install and download the following before proceeding with the Microsoft 365 Moodle plugins installation:

1. Ensure to install a [current stable version of Moodle](https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/).

1. Download and save the Moodle [OpenID Connect](https://moodle.org/plugins/auth_oidc) and the [Microsoft 365 Integration](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_o365) plugins to your local computer.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Installing the OpenID Connect and Microsoft 365 Integration plugins are required for the Teams integration.
    >
    > In addition, the [Microsoft 365 Teams Theme](https://moodle.org/plugins/theme_boost_o365teams) plugin is highly recommended.

### Microsoft 365 Moodle plugins

1. Download the plugins, extract them, and upload to their corresponding folders. For example, extract the OpenID Connect plugin (auth_oidc) to a folder called **oidc**, and upload to the **auth** folder of your Moodle document root.

1. Sign in to your Moodle server as an administrator and select **Site administration**.

1. After the detection of new plugins to be installed, Moodle should redirect you to the install new plugins page. If this doesn't happen, in the **Site administration** page, select **Notifications** in the **General** tab, this should trigger the installation of the plugins.

1. After the plugins are install, go to the **Plugins** tab in the **Site administrator** page, select **Authentication** section link, and enable **OpenID Connect**. It's OK to leave the plugin configuration blank - they'll be filled in later.

1. In the **Site administrator** page, scroll down to the **Local plugins** section and select the **Microsoft 365 Integration** link.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > * Keep your Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugins configuration page open in a separate browser tab as you need to return to this set of pages throughout the process.  
    >
    > * If you do not have an existing Moodle site, go to the [Moodle on Azure](https://github.com/azure/moodle) repo, and quickly deploy a Moodle instance and customize it to your needs.

## Configure the connection between the Microsoft 365 plugins and Microsoft Entra ID

You must configure the connection between the Microsoft 365 plugins and Microsoft Entra ID.

### Requisites

Register Moodle as an application in your Microsoft Entra ID, using the PowerShell script. The script provisions the following:

* A new Microsoft Entra application for your Microsoft 365 tenant, which is used by the Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugins.
* The app for your Microsoft 365 tenant, set up the required reply URLs and permissions for the provisioned app, and returns the `AppID` and `Key`.

Use the generated `AppID` and `Key` in your Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugins setup page to configure your Moodle server site with Microsoft Entra ID.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * For more information on registering your Moodle instance manually, see [Register your Moodle instance as an application](https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Microsoft_365#Azure_App_Creation_and_Configuration).

## Deploy the Moodle Assistant Bot to Azure

The free Moodle assistant bot for Microsoft Teams helps teachers and students answer questions about their courses, assignments, grades, and other information in Moodle. The bot also sends Moodle notifications to students and teachers within Teams. The bot is an open-source project maintained by Microsoft, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Moodle-Teams-Bot).

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Deploy resources to your Azure subscription. All resources were configured using the **free** tier. Depending on the usage of your bot, you may have to scale these resources.
>
> * To use the Moodle tab without the bot, skip to [Deploy your Microsoft Teams app](#deploy-your-microsoft-teams-app).

### Moodle bot information flow

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/MoodleBotInformationFlow.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Moodle bot for Microsoft Teams information flow.":::

To install the bot, you must register it on the [Microsoft identity platform](https://identity.microsoft.com/Landing). This allows your bot to authenticate against your Microsoft endpoints.

To register your bot:

1. Go to the plugins administration page, and then select **Plugins**. Under **Microsoft 365 Integration**, select the **Teams Settings** tab.

1. Select the **Microsoft Application Registration Portal** link and sign in with your Microsoft ID.

1. Enter a name for your app, such as MoodleBot and select the **Create** button.

1. Copy the **Application ID** and paste it into the **Bot Application ID** field on the **Team Settings** page.

1. Select the **Generate New Password** button. Copy the generated password and paste it into the **Bot Application Password** field on the **Team Settings** page.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the form and select **Save Changes**.

After generating your application ID and password, deploy your bot to Azure:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Select **Deploy to Azure** and complete the form with the necessary information, such as the Bot Application ID, Bot Application Password, and the Moodle Secret on the **Teams Settings** page. The Azure information is on the **Setup** page.
>
> * After completing the form, select the checkbox to agree to the terms and conditions.
>
> * Select **Purchase**. All Azure resources are deployed to the free tier.

After the resources have completed deploying to Azure, you must configure the Microsoft 365 Moodle plugins with a messaging endpoint. You must get the endpoint from your bot in Azure:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the left pane, select **Resource groups** and select the resource group you used or created, while deploying your bot.

1. Select the **WebApp Bot** resource from the list of resources in the group.

1. Copy the **Messaging Endpoint** from the **Overview** section.

1. In Moodle, open the **Team Settings** page of your Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugins.

1. In the **Bot Endpoint** field paste the URL you copied and change the word *messages* to *webhook*. The URL must appear as follows: `https://botname.azurewebsites.net/api/webhook`

1. Select **Save Changes**.

1. After saving the changes, go back to the **Team Settings** tab, select the **Download manifest file** button, and save the app manifest package to your computer for further use.

## Deploy your Microsoft Teams app

After your bot is deployed to Azure and configured to talk to your Moodle server, you must deploy your Microsoft Teams app. To do this you must load the app manifest file that you downloaded from the Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugins Team Settings page in the previous step.

Before you install the app, you must ensure to enable external apps and uploading of apps. For more information, see [Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant](../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md).

To deploy your app:

1. Open **Microsoft Teams**.

1. Select the **Apps** icon on the lower-left area of the navigation bar.

1. Select the **Manage your apps** link in the navigation menu.

1. Select **Upload an app** and select **Upload an app to your org's app catalog**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are logged in as a global administrator, you must have the option of uploading the app to your organization's app catalog, otherwise you can only load the app for a team in which you are a member.

1. Select the `manifest.zip` package you downloaded previously and select **Save**. If you haven't downloaded the app manifest package, you can download from the **Team Settings** tab of the plugins configuration page in Moodle.

Now that you have the app installed, you can add the tab to any channel that you have access to. To do so, go to the channel, select the **plus** (➕) symbol and select your app from the list. Follow the prompts to finish adding your Moodle course tab to a channel.

## Allow automatic creation of Moodle tabs in Microsoft Teams

Although the Moodle tabs are created manually in Microsoft Teams, you can decide to create them automatically when teams are created from course synchronization. To do this, you must configure the ID of the uploaded Microsoft Teams app in Moodle.

To allow automatic creation of Moodle tabs:

1. In Moodle, open the **Teams Moodle app** tab from your Microsoft 365 Moodle Plugins configuration page.

1. If the Azure app has the recommended permission, for the **Moodle app ID** setting, it should show an **Automatically detected value**, copy this value to the setting.

1. If the automatically detected value doesn't present, follow the instruction on the page to find the Moodle app ID and fill in the setting.

When a Moodle course is synced, Teams automatically installs the Moodle app in the team, creates a Moodle tab in the General channel of Teams, and configures it to contain the course page for the Moodle course from which it's synced. You can now start working with your Moodle courses directly from Teams.

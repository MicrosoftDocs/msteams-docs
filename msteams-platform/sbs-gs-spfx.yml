    SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a development model to build client-side solutions for Microsoft Teams and SharePoint. Your SPFx Teams app is hosted on Microsoft 365. It provides full support for developing and hosting your client-side SPFx solution. You can integrate your SharePoint Framework solution with:

    - SharePoint data and extend Microsoft Teams. 
    - Your business APIs secured with Azure Active Directory.

    For this tutorial, start Microsoft Teams app development with SPFx by building your first app with a tab capability.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-tab/your-helloworld-app-tab1.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. Tab is highlighted.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Currently, Teams Toolkit offers only the Tab capability in a Teams app with Visual Studio Code and SharePoint Framework. The Bot and Message Extension capabilities are not available.

    </details>

    ## Prepare development environment

    After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.

    ### Install the Teams Toolkit

    The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, or as a CLI (called `teamsfx`).
    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

    1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
    1. In the search box, enter **Teams toolkit**.
    1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-install-toolkit-vscode.png" alt-text="microsoft tool kit":::

        The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar** after it's installed.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar.":::

    You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The latest version of Teams Toolkit is 4.2.0.

    # [Command line](#tab/cli)

    To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

    ``` bash
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

    ``` bash
    sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

    Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

    You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

    ---

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Enable sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
      
    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you will not be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-custom-new1.png" alt-text="bot home":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft 365":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## SharePoint Collection Site Administrator account

    Ensure that you have an Administrator account for a SharePoint Site Collection. You need this account at deployment for hosting. If you're using a Microsoft 365 developer program tenant, you can use the administrator account you created at the time.

    Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

# Start planning your Microsoft Teams app

The Microsoft Teams platform provides a flexible set of capabilities, UI components, and APIs to build your app.

Your Teams app can be as simple as embedding an existing website in a tab, or a multi-faceted app that users interact with across the Teams client. You can create a new experience built entirely for Teams or decide to integrate with another app your users already like.

Whatever your approach, remember that the most successful apps feel native to Teams. While you can start building right away, providing a seamless experience that engages users typically requires careful planning.

Follow these guidelines to help you plan a successful app:

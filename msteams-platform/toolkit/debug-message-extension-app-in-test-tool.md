# Debug message extension app in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground

You can debug bot-based message extension capabilities such as search commands, action commands, and link unfurling using Agents Playground (previously known as Teams App Test Tool) within a simulated environment. Test tool helps you to identify and resolve issues before deploying the extension to a live environment.

Agents Playground enhances the functionality of bot-based message extensions, which are built on top of Bot Framework. When a message extension is activated, Agents Playground sends an invoke request to the app. The app then processes this request and returns an invoke response, which Agents Playground renders and displays.

> [!NOTE]
> The user experience to trigger message extension in Agents Playground is different from Teams, as the goal of Agents Playground is to test and debug the app logic and make the flow simple.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you install the following tools to build and deploy your bot in Agents Playground:

| &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](install-Agents-Toolkit.md) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest release version. |
| &nbsp; | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type). |
| &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |

You can create a dialog with an Action Command in two ways:

* [Adaptive Cards](#create-dialog-with-adaptive-cards)
* [Static list of parameters](#create-dialog-with-static-list-of-parameters)

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/list-of-action-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the list of action commands.":::

#### Create dialog with Adaptive Cards

In the action-based message extension dialog, select **Adaptive Cards**. Agents Playground dynamically retrieves the dialog from the message extension. It sends a `composeExtension/fetchTask` invoke request and then displays the Adaptive Card based on the response received from the app.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/create-dialog-with-adaptive-cards.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows to how create dialog with Adaptive Cards.":::

#### Create dialog with static list of parameters

In the action-based message extension dialog, select **Static list of parameters**. Agents Playground renders the parameters you provided into a dialog. For more information on parameters, see [composeExtensions.commands](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#composeextensionscommands).

The following code is a sample of the static list of parameters in JSON format:

   ```json
   [{
     "name": "title",
     "title": "Card title",
     "description": "Title for the card",
     "inputType": "text"
   },
   {
     "name": "subTitle",
     "title": "Subtitle",
     "description": "Subtitle for the card",
     "inputType": "text"
   },
   {
     "name": "text",
     "title": "Text",
     "description": "Text for the card",
     "inputType": "textarea"
   }]
   ```

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/static-list-of-parameters-in-teams-app-test-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to create a static list of parameters in agents playground.":::

Static list of parameters are available under the `composeExtensions` property in app manifest. For example, see [manifest.json](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/main/templates/ts/message-extension-action/appPackage/manifest.json.tpl#L41-L59).

### Submit form inside the dialog

After you've created a dialog using Adaptive Cards or a static list of parameters and select submit, Agents Playground sends an invoke request with name of `composeExtension/submitAction`.

Based on the invoke response from the message extension, Agents Playground performs one of the following actions:

* Renders an Adaptive Card from the invoke response and inserts it into the message compose area.

* Renders an Adaptive Card from the invoke response inside the dialog. This is useful when the form is extensive and needs to be divided into multiple cards.

* Displays a plain text message from the invoke response inside the dialog.

> [!Note]
> It's not mandatory to include the command ID to test your message extension. Add them if you require to test the functionality.

## Link Unfurling

To test an **Link Unfurling** in Agents Playground, follow these steps:

1. Select the **+** icon in the message compose area.

1. Select **Link Unfurling**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/link-unfurling.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to create a link unfurling in agents playground.":::

   A **Enter a URL** dialog appears.

1. In the **Enter an URL** dialog, enter a URL of your choice.

1. Select **Send to Conversation**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/link-unfurling-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to create link unfurling in agents playground.":::

   Agents Playground triggers a `composeExtension/queryLink` invoke request with the URL to the message extension. You can review the Adaptive Card that Agents Playground renders based on the invoke response from the app.

> [!Note]
> The user experience for testing link unfurling in Agents Playground differs from that in Teams, however you can still test or debug the app logic with Agents Playground in a simple way.

## Message extension Agents Playground FAQ

<br>
<details>
<summary>How can I use `commandId` or `parameters.name` properties for a Search Command in Agents Playground?</summary>

When you use the search box in a search-based message extension in Teams, your app receives an invoke activity that includes two parameters. Sometimes, your app might need to use `activity.value.commandId` or `activity.value.parameters[0].name` to manage different search command behaviors in the activity handler for the `composeExtension/query` invoke activity, such as the `handleTeamsMessagingExtensionQuery` method in the Bot Framework SDK for JavaScript. However, your app doesn't need it because [Teams only supports a single search command](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#composeextensionscommands) and you can leave them empty.

If your app uses these two parameters, you can provide additional inputs by selecting `Specify Command ID or Parameter` and updating the required values. Agents Playground includes these parameters in the invoke activity payload during a search. If you don't specify them, the payload avoids these parameters.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/specify-command-parameter.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the specify command ID or Parameter.":::

In Teams, the parameters are available in the app manifest. Since Agents Playground doesn't process the manifest, you need to input the parameters manually.

<details>
<summary>How can I use `commandId` property for an Action Command in Agents Playground?</summary>

In Teams, dialogs are triggered from action commands and your app receives a `composeExtension/fetchTask` or `composeExtension/submitAction` invoke activity. This activity includes the `activity.value.commandId` parameter. However, your app uses this parameter to differentiate between commands within the activity handler for these invoke activities, such as the `handleTeamsMessagingExtensionFetchTask` or `handleTeamsMessagingExtensionSubmitAction` methods in the Bot Framework SDK for JavaScript.

To test various action commands, you must enter the `Command ID` in the respective field. If you don't update, the command IDs aren't included in the activity payload.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/command-parameter.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the command ID parameter in Action Command.":::

In Teams, commands are available in the app manifest. Since Agents Playground doesn't process the manifest, you need to input the commands manually.

<details>
<summary>How does a static list of parameters work in Agents Playground?</summary>

The static list of parameters is the simple method to create dialogs for action commands, however you can't format the static list.

When you create a dialog using a static list of parameters, the message extension receives a `composeExtension/submitAction` invoke activity upon the user’s submission of the dialog.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/static-list-of-parameters.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the static list of parameter in Action Command.":::

In Teams, the parameters are available in the app manifest. Since Agents Playground doesn't process the manifest, you need to input the parameters manually.

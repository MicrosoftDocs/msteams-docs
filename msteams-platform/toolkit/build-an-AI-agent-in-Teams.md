# Build an AI agent bot in Teams

An AI agent in Microsoft Teams is a conversational chatbot that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with the users. It understands user intentions and selects a sequence of actions, enabling the chatbot to complete common tasks.

        1. Open terminal and run the following command to install all dependency packages:
            ```
            > npm install
            ```
        1. Run the following command to run assistant:
            ```
            > npm run assistant:create -- <your-openai-api-key>
            ```
        1. You'll get an output as **Created a new assistant with an ID of: asst_xxx...**.

## Create an AI agent using Teams AI library

### Build new

Teams AI library provides a comprehensive flow that simplifies the process of building your own AI agent. The important concepts that you need to understand are as follows:

* [**Actions**](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/getting-started/CONCEPTS/ACTIONS.md): An action is an atomic function that is registered to the AI system.
* [**Planner**](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/getting-started/CONCEPTS/PLANNER.md): The planner receives the user's request, which is in the form of a prompt or prompt template, and returns a plan to fulfill it. This is achieved by using AI to mix and match atomic functions, known as actions, that are registered to the AI system. These actions are recombined into a series of steps that complete a goal.
* [**Action Planner**](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/getting-started/CONCEPTS/ACTION-PLANNER.md): Action Planner uses an LLM to generate plans. It can trigger parameterized actions and send text based responses to the user.

### Build with Assistants API

Assistants API from OpenAI simplify the development effort of creating an AI agent. OpenAI as a platform offers prebuilt tools such as Code Interpreter, Knowledge Retrieval, and Function Calling that simplifies the code you need to write for common scenarios.

   | Comparison | Build new | Build with Assistants API |
   | - | - | - |
   | Cost | Only costs for LLM services | Costs for LLM services and if you use tools in Assistants API leads to extra costs. |
   | Dev effort | Medium | Relatively small |
   | LLM services | Azure OpenAI or OpenAI | OpenAI only |
   | Example implementations in template | This app template can chat and help users to manage the tasks. | This app templates use the Code Interpreter tool to solve math problems and also the Function Calling tool to get city weather. |
   | Limitations | NA | The Teams AI library doesn't support the Knowledge Retrieval tool. |

## Customize the app template

### Customize prompt augmentation

The SDK provides a functionality to augment the prompt.

* The actions, which are defined in the `src/prompts/planner/actions.json` file, are inserted into the prompt. This allows the LLM to be aware of the available functions.
* An internal piece of prompt text is inserted into the prompt to instruct LLM to determine which functions to call based on the available functions. This prompt text orders LLM to generate the response in a structured json format.
* The SDK validates the LLM response and lets LLM correct or refine the response if the response is in wrong format.

In the `src/prompts/planner/config.json` file, configure `augmentation.augmentation_type`. The options are:

* `Sequence`: Suitable for tasks that require multiple steps or complex logic.
* `Monologue`: Suitable for tasks that require natural language understanding and generation, and more flexibility and creativity.

### Build new add functions

   * In the `src/prompts/planner/actions.json` file, define your actions schema.
    
     ```json
     [
         ...
         {
             "name": "myFunction",
             "description": "The function description",
             "parameters": {
                 "type": "object",
                 "properties": {
                     "parameter1": {
                         "type": "string",
                         "description": "The parameter1 description"
                     },
                 },
                 "required": ["parameter1"]
             }
         }
     ]
     ```
    
   * In the `src/app/actions.ts` file, define the action handlers.
    
     ```typescript
     // Define your own function
     export async function myFunction(context: TurnContext, state: TurnState, parameters): Promise<string> {
       // Implement your function logic
       ...
       // Return the result
       return "...";
     }
     ```
    
   * In the `src/app/app.ts` file, register the actions.

     ```typescript
     app.ai.action("myFunction", myFunction);
     ```

### Customize assistant creation

The `src/creator.ts` file creates a new OpenAI Assistant. You can customize the assistant by updating the parameters including instruction, model, tools, and functions.

### Build with Assistants API add functions

When the assistant provides a function and its arguments for execution, the SDK aligns this function with a preregistered action. It later activates the action handler and submits the outcome back to the assistant. To integrate your functions, register the actions within the app.

   * In the `src/app/actions.ts` file, define the action handlers.
    
     ```typescript
     // Define your own function
     export async function myFunction(context: TurnContext, state: TurnState, parameters): Promise<string> {
       // Implement your function logic
       ...
       // Return the result
       return "...";
     }
     ```
    
   * In the `src/app/app.ts` file, register the actions.

     ```typescript
     app.ai.action("myFunction", myFunction);
     ```

# Build an AI Agent in Teams

An AI agent in Microsoft Teams is a conversational chatbot that can reason with large language models to interact with users to understand the intention and choose a sequence of actions to take so the chatbot can complete common tasks. Example tasks include querying and summarizing information (for example, "Do you have any flights to DC tomorrow?"), authoring content based on user intent (for example, "Rephrase this sentence to be more professional"), or acting on the userâ€™s behalf (for example, "Please cancel my order").

## Prerequisites

| Install | For using... |

| [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or Python build environments. Use the latest version. |
| [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) | Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest version.|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|

        ## Create your own OpenAI Assistant
        
        Before running or debugging your bot, please follow these steps to setup your own [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).
        
        **If you haven't setup any Assistant yet**
        
        > This app template provides script `src/creator.js` to help create assistant. You can change the instructions and settings in the script to customize the assistant.
        > 
        > After creation, you can change and manage your assistants on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/assistants).
        
        1. Open terminal and run command `npm install` to install all dependency packages
           ```
           > npm install
           ```
        1. After `npm install` completed, run command `npm run assistant:create -- <your-openai-api-key>`
           ```
           > npm run assistant:create -- xxxxxx
           ```
        1. The above command will output something like "*Created a new assistant with an ID of: **asst_xxx...***"
        
        1. Go to **Visual Studio Code**, Under **EXPLORER**, select **env** > **.env.*.userr** file.
        
        1. Update the following details:
            SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
            OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<your-openai-assistant-id>

# Register Teams app in Microsoft Entra ID

Registering your Teams app in Microsoft Entra ID allows the app to access Entra ID-secured services, such as single sign-on (SSO).

## Prerequisites

1. An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, [create an account for free](https://portal.azure.com).
2. The latest version of [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with ASP.NET and web development workloads installed.
3. [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download), a reverse proxy software tool to create a temporary tunnel to a local web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints.
4. A registered Microsoft 365 developer tenant account. If you don't have one, join the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).

## Before you register your app

It's helpful if you learn about the configuration for [registering your app in Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) beforehand. Ensure that you're prepared to configure the following details before you register your app:

* **Single or multitenant options**: Choose single tenant if your app is only used in its home tenant, or choose multitenant if many Microsoft 365 tenants use it regularly. For example, apps created for a single organization are typically single tenant. On the other hand, apps created by an independent software publisher that is used by many customers need to be multitenant so each customer's tenant can access the app.

* **Application ID URI**: It's a globally unique URI that identifies the web API you expose for your app's access through scopes. The application ID URI includes the app ID and the subdomain where your app is hosted. Your app's domain name and the domain name you register for your Microsoft Entra application should be the same. Currently, a single app doesn't support multiple domains.

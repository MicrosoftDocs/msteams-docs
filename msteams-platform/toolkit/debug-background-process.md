# Debug background process

The debugging process involves the `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` files to configure the debuggers in Microsoft Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code launches Node debugger and browser debugger, and Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome launches a new browser instance.

The debugging process workflow is as follows:

1. `launch.json` file configures the debugger in Visual Studio Code.

2. Visual Studio Code runs the compound **preLaunchTask**, **Start Teams App Locally** in `.vscode/tasks.json` file.

3. Visual Studio Code then launches the debuggers specified in the compound configurations, such as **Attach to Bot**, **Attach to Backend**, **Attach to Frontend**, and **Launch Bot**.

4. The browser debugger, Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, launches a new browser instance and opens a webpage to load Microsoft Teams client.

## Validate prerequisites

Microsoft Teams Toolkit checks the following prerequisites during the debugging process:

* Teams Toolkit checks if Node.js is installed. If Node.js isn't installed, the debugging terminates.
* Teams Toolkit checks if Node.js version matches the versions defined in `package.json` file. If the version doesn't match, Teams Toolkit displays a warning message in output channel.
* Teams Toolkit prompts you to sign in to Microsoft 365 account, if you haven't signed in with your valid credentials.
* Custom app upload for your developer tenant is turned on to prevent local debug termination.
* If Ngrok isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, Teams Toolkit installs Ngrok npm package `ngrok@4.2.2` in `~/.fx/bin/ngrok`. Ngrok binary version 2.3 is applicable for bot and message extension and is managed by Ngrok npm package in `/.fx/bin/ngrok/node modules/ngrok/bin`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Teams Toolkit project templates use the ngrok@4.3.3 npm package, which contains v2.3.40. For more information on how to get a valid license, see [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

* If Azure Functions Core Tools version 4 isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, Teams Toolkit installs Azure Functions Core Tools npm package `azure-functions-core-tools@3` for Windows and macOS in  `~/.fx/bin/func`. The Azure Functions Core Tools npm package in `~/.fx/bin/func/node_modules/azure-functions-core-tools/bin` manages Azure Functions Core Tools binary. For Linux, the local debug terminates.
* If .NET Core SDK isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, Teams Toolkit installs .NET Core SDK for Windows and macOS in `~/.fx/bin/dotnet`. .NET Core SDK version is applicable for Azure Functions. For Linux, the local debug terminates.

  The following table lists the .NET Core versions:

  | Platform  | Software|
  | --- | --- |
  |Windows, macOS (x64), and Linux | **3.1 (recommended)**, 5.0, 6.0 |
  |macOS (arm64) |6.0 |

* If the development certificate for localhost isn't installed for tab in Windows or macOS, then Teams Toolkit prompts you to install it.
* If Azure Functions binding extensions isn't installed, then Teams Toolkit installs Azure Functions binding extensions in `api/extensions.csproj`.
* If npm packages aren't installed, then Teams Toolkit installs all npm packages applicable for tab app, bot app, message extension, and Azure Functions.
* Teams Toolkit starts Ngrok to create an HTTP tunnel for bot and message extension.
* If tab, bot, message extension, and Azure Functions ports aren't available, the local debug terminates.

  The following table lists the ports available for components:

  | Component  | Port |
  | --- | --- |
  | Tab | 53000 |
  | Bot or message extension | 3978 |
  | Node inspector for bot or message extension | 9239 |
  | Azure Functions | 7071 |
  | Node inspector for Azure Functions | 9229 |

<!-- The following table lists the limitations if the required software is unavailable for debugging:

|Project type|Installation| Limitation|
|----------|--------------------------------|-----|
|Tab without Azure functions | Node.js LTS versions 10, 12, **14 (recommended)**, 16 | The local debug terminates, if Node.js isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Tab with Azure functions | Node.js LTS versions 10, 12, **14 (recommended)** |The local debug terminates, if Node.js isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Bot | Node.js LTS versions 10, 12, **14 (recommended)**, 16|The local debug terminates, if Node.js isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Message extension | Node.js LTS versions 10, 12, **14 (recommended)**, 16 |The local debug terminates, if Node.js isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement.|
|Sign-in to Microsoft 365 account | Microsoft 365 credentials |Teams Toolkit prompts you to sign-in to Microsoft 365 account, if you haven't signed in. |
|Bot, message extension | Ngrok version 2.3| • If Ngrok isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, the Teams Toolkit installs Ngrok NPM package `ngrok@4.2.2` in `~/.fx/bin/ngrok`. </br> • The Ngrok binary is managed by Ngrok NPM package in `/.fx/bin/ngrok/node modules/ngrok/bin`.|
|Azure functions | Azure Functions Core Tools version 3| • If Azure Functions Core Tools isn't installed or the version doesn't match the requirement, the Teams Toolkit installs Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package, azure-functions-core-tools@3 for **Windows** and for **macOs** in  `~/.fx/bin/func`. </br> • The Azure Functions Core Tools NPM package in `~/.fx/bin/func/node_modules/azure-functions-core-tools/bin` manages Azure Functions Core Tools binary. For Linux, the local debug terminates.|
|Azure functions |.NET Core SDK version|• If .NET Core SDK isn't installed or the version  doesn't match the requirement, the Toolkit installs .NET Core SDK for Windows and macOS in `~/.fx/bin/dotnet`.</br> • For Linux, the local debug terminates.|
|Azure functions | Azure functions binding extensions defined in `api/extensions.csproj`| If Azure functions binding extensions isn't installed, the Toolkit installs Azure functions binding extensions.|
|NPM packages| NPM packages for tab app, bot app, message extension app, and Azure functions|If NPM isn't installed, the Toolkit installs all NPM packages.|
|Bot and message extension | Ngrok |Toolkit starts Ngrok to create a HTTP tunnel for bot and message extension. |

> [!NOTE]
> If tab, bot, message extension, and Azure functions ports are unavailable, the local debug terminates.

Use the following .NET Core versions:

| Platform  | Software|
| --- | --- |
|Windows, macOs (x64), Linux | **3.1 (recommended)**, 5.0, 6.0 |
|macOs (arm64) |6.0 |

> [!NOTE]
> If the development certificate for localhost isn't installed for tab in Windows or MacOS, the Teams Toolkit prompts you to install it.</br> -->

When you select **Start Debugging (F5)**, Teams Toolkit output channel displays the progress and result after checking the prerequisites.

For more information, see [validate prerequisites task](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-tasks/check-prerequisites).

## Start local tunnel

For bot and message extension, Teams Toolkit starts a local tunnel service to make the bot messaging endpoint public. For more information, see [start local tunnel task](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-tasks/local-tunnel).

## Create the debug resources

Teams Toolkit executes lifecycle `provision` defined in `teamsapp.local.yml` to create Teams app related resources required for debugging. For more information, see [Provision task](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-tasks/provision) and [available actions](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-actions).

## Build project

Teams Toolkit executes lifecycle `deploy` defined in `teamsapp.local.yml` to build the project. For more information, see [Deploy task](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-tasks/deploy) and [available actions](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-actions).

## Take a tour of your app source code

You can view the project folders and files under **Explorer** in Visual Studio Code after debugging. The following table lists the files related to debugging:

| Folder name| Contents| Debug configuration type |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  `teamsapp.local.yml` | The main Teams Toolkit project file for debugging. | This file defines the life cycles and actions required for debugging. |
|  `env/.env.local` | Environment variables file for Teams Toolkit project. | The values of each environment variable are consumed or generated during debugging. |
| `.localConfigs` | Environment variables file for the app code. | The values of each environment variable are generated during debugging. |

For more information on the project folder structure, see [Teams Toolkit project](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-v5.0-guide#teams-toolkit-project).

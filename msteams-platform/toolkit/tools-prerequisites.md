### Microsoft 365 developer program

> [!NOTE]
> To build Teams apps, you must have a work or school [Microsoft 365 account](#microsoft-365-developer-program). Microsoft 365 personal account can't be used.

If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional subscription, both programs include a free Microsoft 365 [developer subscription](https://aka.ms/MyVisualStudioBenefits). It's active as long as your Visual Studio subscription is active. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 developer subscription](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).

If you don't have any Microsoft 365 tenant, you might qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365devprogram); for details, see the [FAQ](/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-). Alternatively, you can sign up for a [1-month free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try) or [purchase a Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products-g).

You can sign up for the developer program using one of the following account types:

* **Microsoft account for personal use**

  :::row:::

    :::column span="3":::

       The Microsoft account provides access to the Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook, Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Microsoft 365. 

       Sign up for an Outlook.com mailbox to create a Microsoft 365 account. Use it to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure.

   :::column-end:::

  :::row-end:::

* **Microsoft work account for business**

  :::row:::

    :::column span="3":::

       This account provides access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services. The services include Azure, Microsoft Intune, and Microsoft 365. 

       When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Microsoft Entra ID to represent your organization.

#### Create a free Microsoft 365 developer account

To create a free Microsoft 365 developer account:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
1. Select **Join Now**.
1. Set up your administrator account subscription.

   After the completion of the subscription, the following information appears:

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/m365-account_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the M365 Account subscription options.":::

### Azure account

An Azure account allows you to host a Teams app or the back-end resources for your Teams app to Azure. You can do this using Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio Code. You must have an Azure subscription in the following scenarios:

* If you already have an existing app on a different cloud provider other than Azure, and you want to integrate the app on Teams platform.
* If you want to host the back-end resources for your app using another cloud provider, or on your own servers if they're available in the public domain.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use Azure account to provision Azure resource to host your Teams app. You can [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in case you don't have any. If you don't use Teams Toolkit to provision and deploy, Azure account isn't required.

### SharePoint collection site administrator account

While creating Teams app using SPFx environment, you must have a SharePoint collection site administrator account. Itâ€™s required for deploying and hosting your app on SharePoint site. If you're using a Microsoft 365 developer program tenant, you can use the administrator account you created at the time.

## Verify custom app upload permission

After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

You can verify if the app upload permission is enabled using either Visual Studio Code or Teams client.

<br>
<details>
<summary><b>Verify custom app upload permission using Visual Studio Code</b></summary>

You can use this method to verify custom app upload permission only after you have created an app project using Teams Toolkit. If you haven't created an app project, you can verify custom app upload permission using Teams client.

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
1. Select **Teams Toolkit** from the Visual Studio Code activity bar.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're unable to see the option, see [install Teams Toolkit](install-Teams-Toolkit.md) to install Teams Toolkit extension in Visual Studio Code.

1. Create a new Teams Toolkit app project or open an existing app project.

1. Select **Sign in to Microsoft 365** under **ACCOUNTS**.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/accounts1_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the accounts details.":::

1. Verify if you can see the option **Sideloading enabled** as shown in the following image:

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/sideloading_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the custom app upload enabled option highlighted in red.":::

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b>Verify custom app upload permission using Teams client</b></summary>

1. In the Teams client, select **Apps** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/upload-an-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload an app in Teams.":::

1. Check if you can see the option **Upload a custom app**.

    :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

</details>

### Enable custom app upload using admin center

If the custom app upload option isnâ€™t visible in Teams Toolkit extension in Visual Studio Code or if the option to upload a custom app isnâ€™t available in Teams, it indicates that you don't have the required permission for custom app upload.

You must enable custom app upload in Teams:

* If you're a tenant admin, enable the custom app upload setting for your tenant or organization in the Teams admin center.
* If you aren't a tenant admin, contact your tenant admin to enable custom app upload.

If you have admin rights, you can enable custom app upload:

  1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/homepage#/) with your admin credentials.

  1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/showall icon.PNG"::: icon > **Teams**.

       :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/m365-admin-center_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams client in the left pane of Microsoft 365 Admin center.":::

     > [!Note]
     > It can take up to 24 hours for the Teams option to appear. You can [upload your custom app to a Teams environment](/microsoftteams/upload-custom-apps) for testing and validation.

  1. Sign in to Microsoft Teams admin center with your admin credentials.
  1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/showall icon.PNG"::: icon > **Teams apps** > **Setup policies**.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/m365-admin-center1_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Setup policies under Teams apps in Microsoft 365 Admin center.":::

  1. Select **Global (Org-wide default)**.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/select-manage-policies_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Manage policies tab with Global (Org-wide default) option highlighted.":::

  1. Set **Upload custom apps** toggle to **On**.

     :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/Upload-custom-apps_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Upload custom apps toggle highlighted.":::

  5. Select **Save**.

     > [!Note]
     > It can take up to 24 hours for custom app upload to become active. In the meantime, you can use **upload for your tenant** to test your app. To upload the .zip package file of the app, see [upload custom apps](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies).

     Ensure that you have the app upload permission using the steps mentioned in [verify custom app upload permission using Visual Studio Code or Teams client](#verify-custom-app-upload-permission).

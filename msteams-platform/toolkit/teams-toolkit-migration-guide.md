# Migrate project from 17.9 to 17.10+ version

This guide details the process of migrating from the traditional, scaffolded template to the new project structure in Microsoft Teams. The transition is essential to leverage the latest features and improve project maintainability. The new project structure introduces a more streamlined and efficient way of managing your Teams applications.

`.ttkproj` suffix to represent the new project type. In the new version of 17.10, a Teams solution will contian two projects. One is Teams project, another one is your source code. Teams project contians the Teams app package and Teams Toolkit configuration files, your source code project is the business logic for your tab or bot or other. By separating the concept of Teams app and C# project, we can address the scenario where you already have your existing web or bot solutions and want to embed your web app to Teams or integrate their bot to Teams client. The Teams project makes it easier for you to integrate with any existing project or solution.

Learn in detail to create a new project folder, move configuration files, adjust launch settings, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration process, ensure that you have the following:

* A Teams project that is created using Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio 17.9 or earlier version.
* Multiple startups feature. To enable multiple startups, go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Preview Feature** > **Enable Multi-Project Launch Profiles**.

## Migration process

Perform the following steps to migrate to the new project structure:

1. Create a new folder under the solution folder.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You can provide any name to the new folder but must be meaningful. We recommend that you use the name **TeamsApp**.

1. Create a file under the new folder and name it as **TeamsApp.ttkproj**. Add the following code to the file:

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Project ToolsVersion="15.0" Sdk="Microsoft.TeamsFx.Sdk">
      <ItemGroup>
        <ProjectCapability Include="ProjectConfigurationsDeclaredDimensions" />
      </ItemGroup>
    </Project>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The project file name must match the new folder name; however, discrepancies don't block the Visual Studio system.

1. Move the following configuration folders and files to the new project.

    * Folders: `appPackage`, `env`, `infra`
    * Files: `teamsapp.yml`, `teamsapp.local.yml`, `aad.manifest.json`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These folders and files are automatically included and you needn't add them to the `.ttkproj` manually.

1. According to the old `launchSettings.json`, move the launching browser or test tool capability to `launchSettings.json` of the new project.

    * Create a `launchSettings.json` under the new project.
    * Copy the C# `launchSettings.json` to the new created one.
    * Delete the `dotnetRunMessages`, `launchBrowser`, `applicationUrl`, `environmentVariables`, and `hotReloadProfile` fields of the new `launchSettings.json`, because they aren't used in TeamsApp.
    * Remove the `launchBrowser`, `launchTestTool`, and `launchUrl` in the old `launchSettings.json` file.
    * Remove the duplicated profiles in the earlier `launchSettings.json`.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > * The `launchSettings.json` under the C# of the old project must start by itself.
    > * The `launchSettings.json` under the TeamsApp is configured to launch the browser or the test tool app that communicates with the C# project.
    > * The profile names specified is used in the subsequent steps.

1. Open the solution using Visual Studio (version 17.10 Preview 3 or later) and add the new project to the solution, `TeamsApp/TeamsApp.ttkproj`.

1. Remove `<ProjectCapability Include="TeamsFx"/>` in the old C# project.

1. Create a `{{solutionName}}.slnLaunch.user` file at the same level as the solution file and add the content to the `{{solutionName}}.slnLaunch.user` file, according to the two files of `launchSettings.json`.

    ```json
    [
      {
        "Name": "Microsoft Teams (browser)",
        "Projects": [
          {
            "Path": "TeamsApp\\TeamsApp.ttkproj",
            "Action": "StartWithoutDebugging",
            "DebugTarget": "Microsoft Teams (browser)"
          },
          {
            "Path": "MyTeamsApp8\\MyTeamsApp8.csproj",
            "Action": "Start",
            "DebugTarget": "Start Project"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > The `{{solutionName}}.slnLaunch.user` file specifies which projects to launch and their respective startup configurations. You can define groups of projects that you want to start simultaneously. Ensure that the `DebugTarget` corresponds exactly to the profile names in the `launchSettings.json`.

    Alternatively, you can configure multiple startup profiles through the UI to set up the multiple startup profiles.

      1. Right-click the solution and select **Configure Startup Projects...**.
      1. Select **Multiple start projects** and add more profiles that starts the TeamsApp and the C# project simultaneously. You can rename the profiles as required.
      1. Select **OK**. The `{{solutionName}}.slnLaunch.user` file is automatically saved in the solution folder.

1. Modify the `teamsapp.local.yml` and `teamsapp.yml` files after moving them to the new folder.
1. Every action that changes the C# project must be updated because the path is updated. Focus on the following actions:

    * `uses: file/createOrUpdateJsonFile`: This action might change the `appSettings.json` file of the C# project to configure runtime environments. Update the `target` field to the correct path.
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > You need not modify `launchSettings.json` using `file/createOrUpdateJsonFile`. If present in `teamsapp.local.yml`, remove it.
    * `uses: cli/runDotnetCommand`: This action executes a dotnet command within the C# project to package it. Adjust the `workingDirectory` field to the new path and update the command string with the correct `.csproj` path.
    * `uses: azureAppService/zipDeploy`: This action deploys the packaged file remotely. Update the `workingDirectory` field to the correct path.

    Hereâ€™s an example of how to modify the YAML configurations:

    ```yml
    # For example:
    # Generate runtime appsettings to JSON file
    - uses: file/createOrUpdateJsonFile
      with:
        target: ../MyTeamsApp8/appsettings.Development.json
        content:
          TeamsFx:
            Authentication:
            ClientId: ${{AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID}}
            ClientSecret: ${{SECRET_AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET}}
            InitiateLoginEndpoint: ${{TAB_ENDPOINT}}/auth-start.html
            OAuthAuthority: ${{AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY}}
    
    
    # Triggered when 'teamsapp deploy' is executed
    deploy:
    - uses: cli/runDotnetCommand
      with:
        args: publish --configuration Release MyTeamsApp8.csproj
        workingDirectory: ../MyTeamsApp8
    
    # Deploy your application to Azure App Service using the zip deploy feature.
    # For additional details, refer to https://aka.ms/zip-deploy-to-app-services.
    - uses: azureAppService/zipDeploy
      with:
        # Deploy base folder
        artifactFolder: bin/Release/net8.0/publish
        # The resource id of the cloud resource to be deployed to.
        # This key will be generated by arm/deploy action automatically.
        # You can replace it with your existing Azure Resource id
        # or add it to your environment variable file.
        resourceId: ${{TAB_AZURE_APP_SERVICE_RESOURCE_ID}}
        workingDirectory: ../MyTeamsApp8
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > This step is easy to make mistakes, so you can provision and deploy on the new project to test it.

1. Close the solution and ensure all changes are saved.

# Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Overview

Microsoft Teams Toolkit makes it simple to get started with app development for Microsoft Teams using Microsoft Visual Studio.

* Start with a project template for common custom app built for your org (LOB app) scenarios or from a sample.
* Save setup time with automated app registration and configuration.
* Run and debug to Teams directly from familiar tools.
* Smart defaults for hosting in Microsoft Azure using infrastructure-as-code and Bicep.
* Bring your app to your organization or the Microsoft Teams Store using built-in publishing tools.

### Project templates

You can start with the capability-focused templates such as tabs, bots, and message extensions or by following the existing samples if you're already familiar with Teams app development. Teams Toolkit reduces the complexity of getting started with the help of templates for custom app built for org scenarios and smart defaults to accelerate your time to production.

Perform the following the steps to select templates and app capability:

1. Select **File > New > Project**.

1. Enter **Teams** in the search box and from search results, select **Microsoft Teams App** template.

1. Select **Next**.

### Automatic registration and configuration

You can save time and let the toolkit automatically register the app in Teams Developer Portal. When you first run or debug the app, Teams Toolkit automatically registers the Teams app to your Microsoft 365 tenant and configures settings such as Microsoft Entra ID for your Teams app. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account to control where the app is configured and customize the Microsoft Entra manifest.

### CodeLens to trigger Teams Toolkit lifecycle

Teams Toolkit provides developers with lifecycle actions and grants access to configuration definitions within the teamsapp.yml file. You can now preview and trigger these predefined lifecycle actions using the CodeLens feature directly within the teamsapp.yml file. This streamlined process enhances the development workflow.

```

### Customize resource provision

The provision steps are defined in the `teamsapp.yml` file, under the `provision` property. You can add, remove, or update actions to the `provision` property to define the expected actions you want to do during provision.

#### Reference environment variables in parameter files

Teams Toolkit supports referencing the values from environment variables in the `teamsapp.yml` file, Teams app manifest, Microsoft Entra app manifest, and Azure parameter files. You can use the syntax `${{ENV_VARIABLE_NAME}}` to reference environment variables.

The following example sets the value of environment variable `MY_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` to `subscriptionId`:

```yml
subscriptionId: ${{MY_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
```

#### Customize ARM template files

If the predefined templates don't meet your app requirements, you can create your own ARM template or update existing ARM template and provide the path to `arm/deploy` action as follows:

```yml
- uses: arm/deploy
    with:
      subscriptionId: ${{AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}
      resourceGroupName: ${{AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}}
      templates:
      - path: <path-to-your-arm-template>
        parameters: <path-to-your-parameter-file>
        deploymentName: <arm-deployment-name>
      bicepCliVersion: <bicep-cli-version>
```
  
The `arm/deploy` action support ARM templates that are written in bicep and json format. If you use json format, you can omit the `bicepCliVersion` parameter. You need to have basic knowledge of Azure Resource Manager. For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager documentation](/azure/azure-resource-manager/).

### Manage your resources

You can sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and manage all resources created using Teams Toolkit.

* You can select a resource group from the existing list or the new resource group that you've created.
* You can see the details of the resource group you've selected in the overview section of the table of contents.

### Customize Teams apps

You can customize your bot or the Teams app by adding environment variables to use a Microsoft Entra app that you've created. You can customize the Teams app in the following ways:

* [Use an existing Microsoft Entra app for your Teams app](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app)
* [Use an existing Microsoft Entra app for your bot](#use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-bot)

<a name='use-an-existing-azure-ad-app-for-your-teams-app'></a>

#### Use an existing Microsoft Entra app for your Teams app

To use a Microsoft Entra app created for your Teams app and to add environment variables to the .env files, follow these steps.

1. Open the `teamsapp.yml` file and find the `aadApp/create` action.

1. Find the environment variable names that store information for Microsoft Entra app in the `writeToEnvironmentFile` property. If you create projects using Teams Toolkit the default  `writeToenvironmentFile` property definition is as follows:

     ```yml
      writeToEnvironmentFile:
       clientId: AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID
       clientSecret: SECRET_AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET
       objectId: AAD_APP_OBJECT_ID
       tenantId: AAD_APP_TENANT_ID
       authority: AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY
       authorityHost: AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_HOST
     ```

1. Add values for each environment variable from step 2.

    1. Add the following environment variables and their values to `env\.env.{env}` file. For example:

       ```env
        AAD_APP_CLIENT_ID=<value of Microsoft Entra application's client id (application id)> # example: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        AAD_APP_OBJECT_ID=<value of Microsoft Entra application's object id> # example: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        AAD_APP_TENANT_ID=<value of Microsoft Entra's (tenant) id>> # example: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY=<value of Microsoft Entra's authority> # example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<Directory (tenant) ID>
        AAD_APP_OAUTH_AUTHORITY_HOST=<host of Microsoft Entra's authority> # example: https://login.microsoftonline.com
        AAD_APP_ACCESS_AS_USER_PERMISSION_ID=<id of access_as_user permission> # example: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
       ```  

    1. If your application requires a Microsoft Entra app client secret, add the following environment variable and its value to `env\.env.{env}.user` file. For example:

       ```env
       SECRET_AAD_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=<value of Microsoft Entra application's client secret>
       ```

If you don't have a Microsoft Entra app yet or you've one but don't know where to find the correct value, see [Use existing Microsoft Entra app in TeamsFx project](../use-existing-aad-app.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
> * Remember to update the environment variable names in the examples if you use different names in `writeToEnvironmentFile`.
> * If you don't use `aadApp/create` action to create Microsoft Entra application, you can add necessary environment variables with your preferred name without following above steps.
> * Ensure you do not share the same Microsoft Entra app in multiple environments.

#### Use an existing Microsoft Entra app for your bot

You can follow the steps to add environment variables to the .env files to use a Microsoft Entra app created for your Teams app.

1. Open the `teamsapp.yml` file and find the `botAadApp/create` action.

1. Find the environment variable names that store information for Microsoft Entra app in the `writeToEnvironmentFile` property. The default `writeToEnvironmentFile` definition if you create projects using Teams Toolkit is as follows:

    ```yml
     writeToEnvironmentFile:
       botId: BOT_ID
       botPassword: SECRET_BOT_PASSWORD
    ```

1. Add values for each environment variable from step 2.

    1. Add the environment variable and its value to `env\.env.{env}` file. For example:

       ```env
       BOT_ID=<value of Microsoft Entra application's client id (application id)> # example: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000    
       ```

    1. Add the environment variable and its value to `env\.env.{env}.user` file. For example:

       ```env
       SECRET_BOT_PASSWORD=<value of Microsoft Entra application's client secret>
       ```

If you don't have a Microsoft Entra app for your bot yet or you've one but don't know where to find the correct values, see [Use existing Microsoft Entra app in TeamsFx project](../use-existing-aad-app.md).

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Remember to update the environment variable names in the examples if you use different names in `writeToEnvironmentFile`.
> * If you don't use `botAadApp/create` action to create Microsoft Entra application, you can add necessary environment variables with your preferred name without following above steps.
> * Ensure that you do not share the same Microsoft Entra app in multiple environments.

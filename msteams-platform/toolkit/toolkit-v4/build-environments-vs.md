# Prepare to build apps using Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio

Microsoft Teams Toolkit supports different build environments for creating apps. It helps to integrate Microsoft Azure Functions capabilities and cloud services in the Microsoft Teams app that you've built.

## Build environments

Teams Toolkit in Microsoft Visual Studio offers a set of environments to build your Teams app in C# using Blazor framework.

### Create your Teams app using C# and Blazor

Use Teams Toolkit in Visual Studio to create a Teams app using C# using the Blazor framework. You can create tab app, bot app, and message extension app in a C# build environment.

## Support for Azure Functions

You can use Teams Toolkit to integrate [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) capabilities while building apps. You can focus on the pieces of code that matter, and Azure Functions handles the rest.
Azure Functions provides "compute on-demand" in two significant ways:

1. Allows implementing system's logic into your readily available blocks of code. These blocks are called functions.
1. Meets the requirement with as many resources and function instances as necessary as the requests increase.

Azure Functions integrates with an array of [cloud services](deploy-vs.md#deploy-microsoft-teams-app-to-the-cloud-using-microsoft-visual-studio) to provide feature-rich implementations. The following are the common scenarios for Azure Functions:

* Building a web API
* Processing to database changes
* Processing IoT data streams
* Managing message queues

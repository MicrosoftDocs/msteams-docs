# Microsoft 365 Agents Playground for Visual Studio

Microsoft 365 Agents Playground (previously known as Teams App Test Tool) makes debugging bot-based apps effortless. You can chat with your bot and see its messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in Microsoft Teams. You donâ€™t need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or Teams app and bot registration to use Agents Playground.

The following image shows a sample app displaying a response in Agents Playground:

The following are the advantages of Agents Playground:

* **Sandbox environment**: The sandbox environment of Agents Playground emulates the behavior, look, and user experience of Teams.

* **Tunneling**: An external tunnel service isn't necessary as Agents Playground runs on a local server that your bot can communicate with.

* **Reduce account dependencies**: Microsoft 365 Developer tenant and the app uploading permissions aren't necessary to debug the bot.

* **Rapid inner-loop iterations**: Optimizes the process of making changes to the app design and bot logic without having to redeploy the bot to the cloud.

* **Mock data and activities**: Agents Playground makes it easy to test complex scenarios such as, sending a welcome message when a new member joins the channel and using mock data and activity triggers.

* **Reliable**: Agents Playground is reliable as the bot's Adaptive Card utilizes the same rendering technology as in Teams.

* **Integration with existing Teams bot applications**: Agents Playground integrates effortlessly with existing Teams bot applications built with Bot Framework SDK.

* **Support for different scopes**: Agents Playground supports testing in personal, team, and group chat scopes.

## Activity triggers

You can mock an activity in Agents Playground using activity triggers. There are two types of activity triggers:

* [Predefined activity triggers](#predefined-activity-triggers)
* [Custom activity triggers](#custom-activity-triggers)

### Predefined activity triggers

Agents Playground provides predefined activity triggers to test the functionalities of your bot.

| Category | Activity | Handler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger Installation Update Activity | Install bot <br><br><br> Uninstall bot | `onInstallationUpdate` <br> `onInstallationUpdateAdded` <br><br> `onInstallationUpdate` <br> `onInstallationUpdateRemove`|
| Trigger Conversation Update Activity | Add user <br><br> Add bot <br><br> Add channel | `onMembersAdded`<br><br> `onTeamsMembersAddedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsChannelRenamedEvent` |
| | Remove user <br><br><br> Remove bot <br><br><br> Remove channel <br><br> Remove team | `onMembersRemoved` <br> `onTeamsMembersRemovedEvent` <br><br> `onMembersRemoved` <br> `onTeamsMembersRemovedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsChannelDeletedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsTeamDeletedEvent` |
| | Rename channel <br><br> Rename team | `onTeamsChannelRenamedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsTeamRenamedEvent` |

> [!NOTE]
> All types of activities aren't available in all scopes. For example, you can't add or remove a channel in a personal chat or a group chat.

Predefined activity triggers are available in the **Mock an Activity** menu in Agents Playground. In this scenario, we're using **Add user** activity trigger as an example. To mock an **Add user** activity, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to **Solution Explorer**.
1. Select the **Program.cs** file.
1. In the **Program.cs** file, under `builder.Services.AddTransient<IBot>(sp =>` add the following code:

    ```csharp
    app.OnConversationUpdate("membersAdded", async (context, state, cancellationToken) =>
    {
       await context.SendActivityAsync($"new member added", cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
    });
    ```

    The `OnConversationUpdate` handler recognizes the members who join the conversation as described by the Add user activity.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/add-a-user-code-vs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the code added to program.cs file for predefined mock activity add user.":::

1. In Agents Playground, go to **Mock an Activity** and select **Add user**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/add-user-vs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the add user option under mock an activity.":::

   A pop-up dialog appears to preview the activity handler.

1. Select **Send activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/add-a-user-request-vs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to send activity for predefined mock activity add user.":::

   Bot sends a response.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/add-a-user-response-vs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the response of predefined mock activity add user.":::

### Custom activity triggers

You can use **Custom activity** to customize activity trigger `reactionsAdded`, to fit the requirements of your bot app. Agents Playground automatically populates the required properties of the activity. You can also modify the activity type and add more properties such as, `MembersAdded`, `membersremoved`, and `reactionsremoved`.

1. In Visual Studio Code, go to **Solution Explorer**.
1. Select the **Program.cs** file.
1. In the **Program.cs** file, under `builder.Services.AddTransient<IBot>(sp =>` add the following code:

    ```csharp
    app.OnMessageReactionsAdded(async (context, state, cancellationToken) =>
    {
       await context.SendActivityAsync($"reaction added.", cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
    });
    ```

    The `OnMessageReactionsAdded` handler identifies the reaction to append by using the `ReplyToId` property of the earlier conversation.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/custom-activity-code-vs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the code added to program.cs file for customization on mock activity.":::

1. Go to Agents Playground webpage and select the latest response from Log Panel to copy `replyToId`.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/custom-activity-reply-to-do.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selection of replyToID to copy for customization on mock activity.":::

1. Select **Mock an Activity** > **Custom activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/mock-activity-vs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the list of option under mock an activity.":::

1. To customize the activity, add `messageReaction` under the `type` property.
1. Replace with the latest `replyToId`.

    ```json
    {
      "type": "messageReaction",
      "reactionsAdded": [
        {
          "type": "like"
        }
      ],
      "replyToId": "d60fd1cb-3e8f-44ef-849c-404806ba1b47"
    }
    ```

1. Select **Send activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug-VS/custom-activity-request-vs.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to send activity after customization on mock activity.":::

   Bot sends an `onReactionsAdded` handler in response.

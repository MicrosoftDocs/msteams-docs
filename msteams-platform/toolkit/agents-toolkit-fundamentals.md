### Composable automation tasks

Automate repetitive or tedious configuration using a composable task framework that creates app IDs, bot registrations, Microsoft Entra apps, and so on.

### Multiple environments

Test your app with different groupings of hosted resources by creating unique configurations such as `dev`, `test`, and `prod` using the Environments features.

### Quick access to Teams Developer Portal

You can access Teams Developer Portal where you can configure, publish, and manage your app. For more information, see [manage your Teams apps using Developer Portal](../concepts/build-and-test/manage-your-apps-in-developer-portal.md).

### Debug tunneling for bots

Run and debug your bot projects using Visual Studio Code and the included Dev Tunnels features.

### Microsoft 365 Agents Playground

Microsoft 365 Agents Playground (previously known as Teams App Test Tool) makes debugging bot-based apps effortless. You can chat with your bot and see its messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in Teams. You donâ€™t need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or Teams app and bot registration to use Agents Playground. For more information, see [Agents Playground](debug-your-Teams-app-test-tool.md).

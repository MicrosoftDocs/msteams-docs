# Microsoft 365 Agents Playground

> [!NOTE]
>
> Microsoft 365 Agents Playground (previously known as Teams App Test Tool) is available in the latest prerelease version of Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit). Ensure that you install the [latest prerelease version](install-Teams-Toolkit.md#install-a-prerelease-version) of Agents Toolkit.

Agents Playground makes debugging bot or agent-based apps effortless. You can chat with your bot and see its messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in different channels. You donâ€™t need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or real client app and application registration to use Agents Playground.

The following image shows a sample app displaying an Adaptive Card with a list of commands in Agents Playground. It also provides a description of the commands so that you can test your app without manually searching your code:

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/sample-app-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Agents Playground Adaptive Card.":::

The following are the advantages of Agents Playground:

* **Sandbox environment**: The sandbox environment of Agents Playground emulates the behavior, look, and user experience of the real one.

* **Tunneling**: An external tunnel service isn't necessary as Agents Playground runs on a local server that your bot can communicate with.

* **Reduce account dependencies**: Microsoft 365 Developer tenant and the app uploading permissions aren't necessary to debug the application.

* **Rapid inner-loop iterations**: Optimizes the process of making changes to the app design and application logic without having to redeploy the application to the cloud.

* **Mock data and activities**: Agents Playground makes it easy to test complex scenarios such as, sending a welcome message when a new member joins the channel, using mock data and activity triggers.

* **Reliable**: Agents Playground is reliable as the application's Adaptive Card utilizes the same rendering technology as in Teams or WebChat.

* **Integration with existing applications**:  Agents Playground integrates effortlessly with existing applications built with Agent SDK or Teams AI library.

* **Support for different scopes**: Agents Playground supports testing in personal, team, and group chat scopes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you install the following tools for building and deploying your applications in Agents Playground:

| &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| &nbsp; | [Agents Toolkit](install-Teams-Toolkit.md) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest prerelease version. |
| &nbsp; | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type). |
| &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |

## Understand Agents Playground

Agents Playground is an npm package that has a CLI command called `teamsapptester`. When you run `teamsapptester start`, it opens a web app on your local machine that emulates the Teams or WebChat client and Bot Framework service. This web app doesn't need any cloud resources as it uses mock data to simulate the contextual information.

To use an application on Agents Playground, you need to provide:

* Message endpoint: A message endpoint is the URL that links Agents Playground and your application. You can update the endpoint with the `BOT_ENDPOINT` environment variable, start Agents Playground with option `--app-endpoint`, or just use the default value of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`.
* Configuration file (Optional): A configuration file informs Agents Playground about your customized contextual information in Teams. The file is named **.m365agentsplayground.yml** in the project's root folder. If Teams can't find this file, it uses the default configuration. For more information, see [customize Teams context](#customize-teams-context).

## Activity triggers

You can mock an activity in Agents Playground using activity triggers. There are two types of activity triggers:

1. [Predefined activity triggers](#predefined-activity-triggers)
1. [Custom activity triggers](#custom-activity-triggers)

### Predefined activity triggers

Agents Playground provides predefined activity triggers to test the functionalities of your app.

| Category | Activity | Handler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger Installation Update Activity | Install application <br><br><br> Uninstall application | `onInstallationUpdate` <br> `onInstallationUpdateAdded` <br><br> `onInstallationUpdate` <br> `onInstallationUpdateRemove`|
| Trigger Conversation Update Activity | Add user <br><br> Add application <br><br> Add channel | `onMembersAdded`<br><br> `onTeamsMembersAddedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsChannelRenamedEvent` |
| | Remove user <br><br><br> Remove application <br><br><br> Remove channel <br><br> Remove team | `onMembersRemoved` <br> `onTeamsMembersRemovedEvent` <br><br> `onMembersRemoved` <br> `onTeamsMembersRemovedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsChannelDeletedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsTeamDeletedEvent` |
| | Rename channel <br><br> Rename team | `onTeamsChannelRenamedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsTeamRenamedEvent` |

> [!NOTE]
> All types of activities aren't available in all scopes. For example, you can't add or remove a channel in a personal chat or a group chat.

Predefined activity triggers are available in the **Mock an Activity** menu in Agents Playground.

To mock an **Add user** activity, follow these steps:

1. In Agents Playground, go to **Mock an Activity** and select **Add user**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/add-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the add user option under mock an activity.":::

   A pop-up window appears to preview the activity handler.

1. Select **Send activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/add-a-user-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to send activity for predefined mock activity add user.":::

   App sends a response.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/add-a-user-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the response of predefined mock activity add user.":::

### Custom activity triggers

You can use **Custom activity** to customize activity triggers such as, `reactionsAdded`, to fit the requirements of your bot app. Agents Playground automatically populates the required properties of the activity. You can also modify the activity type and add more properties.

1. Select **Mock an Activity** > **Custom activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/mock-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the list of option under mock an activity.":::

1. Add `messageReaction` to customize the activity under the property `type` and invoke the custom activity.

    ```json
    {
      "type": "messageReaction",
      "reactionsAdded": [
        {
          "type": "like"
        }
      ],
      "replyToId": "d60fd1cb-3e8f-44ef-849c-404806ba1b47"
    }
    ```

1. Select **Send activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/custom-activity-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to send activity after customization on mock activity.":::

   Bot sends an `onReactionsAdded` handler in response.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/custom-activity-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the response of custom mock activity.":::

## Configure Agents Playground for authentication

When debugging an application that requires authentication, you can configure the Microsoft Entra client ID and client secret, with an optional tenant ID. If you've created your bot using the Azure AI Bot Service, the credentials are available in the bot's App Service under **Settings** > **Configuration**.
If you're unsure of the values, you can remove them from the configuration file of the locally running application and then run the application in the Agents Playground. If the application doesn't require these settings to run, you don't need to configure them.

### Environment variable / Command line

Before starting Agents Playground, you can set the following environment variables: `AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AUTH_TENANT_ID`. These values are used for the default authentication configuration.

When running Agents Playground from the command line, you can also use the options: `--client-id`, `--client-secret`, and `--tenant-id`.These options override the default environment variable settings.

### Client side interface

After Agents Playground has started, you can still configure authentication through the client interface as follows:

1. Select **Configure Authentication**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/configure-authentication.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to configure authentication on agents playground menu bar.":::

1. Fill in fields in the form and select **Save**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/authentication-form.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the form of authentication parameters and the save button.":::

The log panel shows the message if the configuration is successfully set.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/authentication-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the log panel message of successfully configure authentication settings.":::

### Authentication logic

Agents Playground acquires a JWT token using the provided authentication settings and includes it in the **Authorization** header when communicating with the application. The JWT token in the application's response header also is validated by Agents Playground. For more details about the authentication process, see [Authentication with the Bot Connector API](/azure/bot-service/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-connector-authentication).

## Multiple channel support

Teams is the default channel used for debugging your application, but other channels are also supported. You can change the channel by setting the `DEFAULT_CHANNEL_ID` environment variable or by using the `--channel-id` option when starting Agents Playground from the command line.

Currently, the accepted channel IDs are: `msteams`, `directline`, `webchat`, and `emulator`. When you set a channel ID, the properties of the messages sent to the application changes accordingly to simulate a real environment. For the `directline` and `webchat` channels, a corresponding client is displayed, and card rendering differs from that of the Teams channel.

:::image type="content" source="../assets/images/toolkit-v2/debug/webchat-ui.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the card rendering result when using different channel.":::

## Customize Teams context

The configuration file in the project's root folder allows you to customize Teams context information such as chats, teams, and users. It provides mock data for testing Bot Framework APIs or methods from the Agent SDK or Teams AI Library, such as `TeamsInfo.getTeamMembers`.

### Default configuration

<details><summary>Agents Playground contains a built-in configuration file in the project's root folder.</summary>

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://aka.ms/teams-app-test-tool-config/0.1.0/config.schema.json
# Visit https://aka.ms/teams-app-test-tool-config-guide for more details on this file.

# This configuration file customizes the Teams context information like chats, teams, and users.
# It contains mock data for testing Bot Framework APIs or Bot Builder SDK methods such as TeamsInfo.getTeamMembers().
# You can customize this file to change API response if your bot code uses these APIs.

</details>

### Update the configuration file

If your bot code uses Bot Framework APIs, you can modify the configuration file to customize the API responses. For example, consider an Azure DevOps notification bot installed in a team that fetches inactive bugs from Azure DevOps. It identifies the owners of the inactive bugs, retrieves their email addresses, and sends daily notifications to their personal chats.

To comprehensively test this bot in Agents Playground, ensure to update the configuration file with the correct email addresses of the inactive bug owners.

1. Go to the `.m365agentsplayground.yml` file in the project's root folder.

1. Go to the `users` section and update the `name`, `userPrincipleName`, and `email` of the required user.

    ```yaml
    users:
        - id: user-id-1
          name: Megan Bowen
          userPrincipleName: meganb@example.com
          aadObjectId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000021
          givenName: Megan
          surname: Bowen
          email: some-real-user@real-domain.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

1. Save the file and select **F5** to debug in Agents Playground.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit the configuration file in Visual Studio Code, Intellisense automatically updates the property names and warns you if you enter invalid values.

It's important to understand that updating the configuration file has three major impacts:

* It affects the responses returned by Bot Framework Connector APIs. For example, `TeamsInfo.getPagedMembers()`.
* It modifies the details in the activity payload. For example, `activity.recipient`.
* It influences the user interface in Agents Playground. For example, group chat names.

## Limitations

* Bot or agent features enabled through the Teams app manifest aren't available as Agents Playground doesn't process it.

* Agents Playground doesn't support all types of cards except Adaptive Cards.

* Agents Playground doesn't support the following Adaptive Card features:

  * [Typeahead search](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/dynamic-search.md)
  * [User mention](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md#microsoft-azure-active-directory-azure-ad-object-id-and-upn-in-user-mention)

    ```

1. Under **EXPLORER**, create a **.localConfigs.playground** file and add the following code:

    ```json
    // .localConfigs.playground
    # A gitignored place holder file for local runtime configurations when debug in Agents Playground
    BOT_ID=
    BOT_PASSWORD=
    TEAMSFX_NOTIFICATION_STORE_FILENAME=.notification.playgroundstore.json
    ```

1. Go to **EXPLORER** > **env**.
1. Create a **.env.playground** fileâ€¯and add the following code:

    ```json
    // .env.playground
    # This file includes environment variables that can be committed to git. It's gitignored by default because it represents your local development environment
    # Built-in environment variables
    TEAMSFX_ENV=playground
    # Environment variables used by Agents Playground
    TEAMSAPPTESTER_PORT=56150
    ```

1. If you have custom environment variables, set their values inâ€¯**.env.playground**â€¯orâ€¯**.env.playground.user**.

1. Add either an OpenAI key or Azure OpenAI key and endpoint in **.env.playground.user**.

    ```json
    # SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=***********
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=***********
    SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<https://your-openai-service-name.openai.azure.com/>
    ```

1. Go to **package.json** and add the following code under the `scripts` property:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        ... 
        "dev:teamsfx:playground": "env-cmd --silent -f .localConfigs.playgroundnd npm run dev", 
        "dev:teamsfx:launch-playground": "env-cmd --silent -f env/.env.playground teamsapptester start", 
        ... 
    },

# Add cloud resources and API connection

Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit) enables you to provision cloud resources for hosting your app, tailored to your development needs. By adding more cloud resources in TeamsFx, you can autogenerate all configuration files and seamlessly connect to the Teams app using Agents Toolkit. Additionally, Agents Toolkit allows you to access and use existing APIs, whether developed by your organization or a third party, for building Teams apps.

> [!NOTE]
> If you've created SharePoint Framework (SPFx) based tab project, you can't add Azure cloud resources.

# Add capabilities to Microsoft Teams app

Teams Toolkit project templates focus on getting started with an app that implements a single [app capability](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/design/app-structure). However, apps can have multiple capabilities. We've created a set of How-To guides with the steps needed to add different capabilities to a project created with Teams Toolkit.

## How-to guides for adding capabilities

|**Capability** | **How-to Guide** |
|----------|----------|
| Configure Tab Capability | [How to configure Tab capability within your Teams app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/How-to-configure-Tab-capability-within-your-Teams-app) |
| Configure Bot Capability | [How to configure Bot capability within your Teams app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/How-to-configure-Bot-capability-within-your-Teams-app) |
| Configure Message Extension Capability | [How to configure Message Extension capability within your Teams app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/How-to-configure-Message-Extension-capability-within-your-Teams-app) |
| Configure Outlook add-in Capability | [How to configure Outlook add-in capability within your Teams app](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Configure-Outlook-Add-in-capability-within-your-Teams-app) |

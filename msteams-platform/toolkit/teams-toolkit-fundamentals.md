### Quick access to Teams Developer Portal

You can access Teams Developer Portal where you can configure, publish, and manage your app. For more information, see [manage your Teams apps using Developer Portal](../concepts/build-and-test/manage-your-apps-in-developer-portal.md).

### Debug tunneling for bots

Run and debug your bot projects using Visual Studio Code and the included Dev Tunnels features.

### Teams App Test Tool

Teams App Test Tool (Test Tool) makes debugging bot-based apps effortless. You can chat with your bot and see its messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in Teams. You donâ€™t need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or Teams app and bot registration to use Test Tool. For more information, see [Test Tool](debug-your-Teams-app-test-tool.md).

# Teams App Test Tool

> [!NOTE]
>
> Teams App Test Tool is available in the latest prerelease version of the Microsoft Teams Toolkit. Ensure that you install the [latest prerelease version](install-Teams-Toolkit.md#install-a-pre-release-version) of the Teams Toolkit.

Teams App Test Tool (Test Tool) makes debugging bot-based apps effortless. You can chat with your bot and see its messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in Microsoft Teams. You donâ€™t need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or Teams app and bot registration to use Test Tool.

The following image shows a sample app displaying an Adaptive Card with a list of commands in Test Tool. It also provides a description of the commands so that you can test your app without manually searching your code:

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/sample-app-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Teams App Test Tool Adaptive Card.":::

The following are the advantages of Test Tool:

* **Sandbox environment**: The sandbox environment of Test Tool emulates the behavior, look, and user experience of Teams.

* **Tunneling**: An external tunnel service isn't necessary as Test Tool runs on a local server that your bot can communicate with.

* **Reduce account dependencies**: Microsoft 365 Developer tenant and the app uploading permissions aren't necessary to debug the bot.

* **Rapid inner-loop iterations**: Optimizes the process of making changes to the app design and bot logic without having to redeploy the bot to the cloud.

* **Mock data and activities**: Test Tool makes it easy to test complex scenarios such as, sending a welcome message when a new member joins the channel, using mock data and activity triggers.

* **Reliable**: Test Tool is reliable as the bot's Adaptive Card utilizes the same rendering technology as in Teams.

* **Integration with existing Teams bot applications**: Test Tool integrates effortlessly with existing Teams bot applications built with Bot Framework SDK.

* **Support for different scopes**: Test Tool supports testing in personal, team, and group chat scopes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you install the following tools for building and deploying your bots in Test Tool:

| &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| &nbsp; | [Teams Toolkit](install-Teams-Toolkit.md) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest prerelease version. |
| &nbsp; | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type). |
| &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |

## Understand Test Tool

Test Tool is an npm package that has a CLI command called `teamsapptester`. When you run `teamsapptester start`, it opens a web app on your local machine that emulates the Teams web client and Bot Framework service. This web app doesn't need any cloud resources as it uses mock data to simulate the contextual information of Teams.

To use a Teams bot on Test Tool, you need to provide:

* Message endpoint: A bot message endpoint is the URL that links Test Tool and your bot. You can update the endpoint with the `BOT_ENDPOINT` environment variable or use the default value of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`.
* Configuration file (Optional): A configuration file informs Test Tool about your customized contextual information in Teams. The file is named **.teamsapptesttool.yml** in the project's root folder. If Teams can't find this file, it uses the default configuration. For more information, see [customize Teams context](#customize-teams-context).

## Activity triggers

You can mock an activity in Test Tool using activity triggers. There are two types of activity triggers:

1. [Predefined activity triggers](#predefined-activity-triggers)
1. [Custom activity triggers](#custom-activity-triggers)

### Predefined activity triggers

Test Tool provides predefined activity triggers to test the functionalities of your bot.

| Category | Activity | Handler |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trigger Installation Update Activity | Install bot <br><br><br> Uninstall bot | `onInstallationUpdate` <br> `onInstallationUpdateAdded` <br><br> `onInstallationUpdate` <br> `onInstallationUpdateRemove`|
| Trigger Conversation Update Activity | Add user <br><br> Add bot <br><br> Add channel | `onMembersAdded`<br><br> `onTeamsMembersAddedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsChannelRenamedEvent` |
| | Remove user <br><br><br> Remove bot <br><br><br> Remove channel <br><br> Remove team | `onMembersRemoved` <br> `onTeamsMembersRemovedEvent` <br><br> `onMembersRemoved` <br> `onTeamsMembersRemovedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsChannelDeletedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsTeamDeletedEvent` |
| | Rename channel <br><br> Rename team | `onTeamsChannelRenamedEvent` <br><br> `onTeamsTeamRenamedEvent` |

> [!NOTE]
> All types of activities aren't available in all scopes. For example, you can't add or remove a channel in a personal chat or a group chat.

Predefined activity triggers are available in the **Mock an Activity** menu in Test Tool.

To mock an **Add user** activity, follow these steps:

1. In Test Tool, go to **Mock an Activity** and select **Add user**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/add-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the add user option under mock an activity.":::

   A pop-up window appears to preview the activity handler.

1. Select **Send activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/add-a-user-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to send activity for predefined mock activity add user.":::

   Bot sends a response.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/add-a-user-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the response of predefined mock activity add user.":::

### Custom activity triggers

You can use **Custom activity** to customize activity triggers such as, `reactionsAdded`, to fit the requirements of your bot app. Test Tool automatically populates the required properties of the activity. You can also modify the activity type and add more properties.

1. Select **Mock an Activity** > **Custom activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/mock-activity.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the list of option under mock an activity.":::

1. Add `messageReaction` to customize the activity under the property `type` and invoke the custom activity.

    ```json
    {
      "type": "messageReaction",
      "reactionsAdded": [
        {
          "type": "like"
        }
      ],
      "replyToId": "d60fd1cb-3e8f-44ef-849c-404806ba1b47"
    }
    ```

1. Select **Send activity**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/custom-activity-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to send activity after customization on mock activity.":::

   Bot sends an `onReactionsAdded` handler in response.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/debug/custom-activity-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the response of custom mock activity.":::

## Customize Teams context

The configuration file in the project's root folder allows you to customize Teams context information such as chats, teams, and users. The file provides mock data for testing Bot Framework APIs or Bot Builder SDK methods such as `TeamsInfo.getTeamMembers`.

### Default configuration

<details><summary>Test Tool contains a built-in configuration file in the project's root folder.</summary>

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://aka.ms/teams-app-test-tool-config/0.1.0/config.schema.json
# Visit https://aka.ms/teams-app-test-tool-config-guide for more details on this file.

# This configuration file customizes the Teams context information like chats, teams, and users.
# It contains mock data for testing Bot Framework APIs or Bot Builder SDK methods such as TeamsInfo.getTeamMembers().
# You can customize this file to change API response if your bot code uses these APIs.

### Update the configuration file

If your bot code uses Bot Framework APIs, you can modify the configuration file to alter the API response. Let us consider an Azure DevOps notification bot installed in a team that fetches inactive bugs from Azure DevOps. It identifies the owners of the inactive bug, fetches their email addresses, and sends notifications to their personal chats on a daily basis.

To comprehensively test this bot in Test Tool, it's crucial to update the configuration file to use the correct email addresses of the owners of the inactive bugs.

1. Go to the `.teamsapptesttool.yml` file in the project's root folder.

1. Go to the `users` section and update the `name`, `userPrincipleName`, and `email` of the required user.

    ```yaml
    users:
        - id: user-id-1
          name: Megan Bowen
          userPrincipleName: meganb@example.com
          aadObjectId: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000021
          givenName: Megan
          surname: Bowen
          email: some-real-user@real-domain.onmicrosoft.com
    ```

1. Save the file and select **F5** to debug in Test Tool.

> [!NOTE]
> When you edit the configuration file in Visual Studio Code, Intellisense automatically updates the property names and warns you if you enter invalid values.

It's vital to recognize that updating the configuration file has three major impacts:

* It influences the responses obtained from Bot Framework Connector APIs, for example, `TeamsInfo.getPagedMembers()`.
* It shapes the details in the activity payload, for example, `activity.recipient`.
* It impacts the user interface in Test Tool, for example, group chat names.

## Limitations

* Bot features enabled through the Teams app manifest aren't available as Test Tool doesn't process it.

* Test Tool doesn't support all types of cards except Adaptive Cards.

* Test Tool doesn't support the following Adaptive Card features:

  * [Typeahead search](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/dynamic-search.md)
  * [User mention](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md#microsoft-azure-active-directory-azure-ad-object-id-and-upn-in-user-mention)
  * [Stageview](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md#stageview-for-images-in-adaptive-cards)
  * [Full width](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format.md#full-width-adaptive-card)

* Test Tool doesn't support the following experiences:

  * Mobile
  * Meeting

* Test Tool can emulate the following experiences:

   | Features | Debug in Test Tool | [Debug your Teams app locally](debug-local.md) |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Basic sending / receiving messages | Available | Available |
   | Bot Framework APIs (TeamsInfo.getPagedMembers()...) |Available (respond with mocked data) | Available |
   | Sending Teams events | Available (mock activity) |Available |
   | Typing indicator | Not Available | Available |
   | Tab, Message extension, Dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x), Single sign-on (SSO), and non-Adaptive Cards | Not Available | Available |

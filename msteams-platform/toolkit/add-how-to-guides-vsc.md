# How-to guides for Microsoft Teams apps

Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit) project templates focus on getting started with an app that implements a single [app capability](~/concepts/design/app-structure.md). However, apps can have multiple capabilities. We've created a set of How-to guides with the steps needed to add different capabilities to a project created with Agents Toolkit.

## How-to guides for adding capabilities

|**Capability** | **How-to Guide** |
|----------|----------|
| Configure Tab Capability | [How to configure Tab capability within your Teams app](configure-tab-capability.md) |
| Configure Bot Capability | [How to configure Bot capability within your Teams app](configure-bot-capability.md) |
| Configure Message Extension Capability | [How to configure Message Extension capability within your Teams app](configure-message-extension-capability.md) |
| Configure Outlook add-in Capability | [How to configure Outlook add-in capability within your Teams app](../m365-apps/combine-office-add-in-and-teams-app.md) |

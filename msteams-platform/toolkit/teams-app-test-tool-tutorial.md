# Debug your AI chat bot using Microsoft 365 Agents Playground

Start Microsoft Teams app development with your Teams AI chat bot app and debug with Microsoft 365 Agents Playground (previously known as Teams App Test Tool). Agents Playground makes debugging bot-based apps effortless. You don't need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or Teams app and bot registration to use Agents Playground.

You can chat with your bot and view the messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in Teams. You can also mock an activity in Agents Playground using activity triggers.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Agents Playground is available only in v5.4.0 of Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit).
> * Agents Playground is supported only for desktop and web clients.

This step-by-step guide helps you to build an AI chat bot using Agents Toolkit and debug with the Test Tool. You'll see the following output after you've completed this guide, where the user can access and use the AI chat bot:

    A proactive message is a message sent by a bot in response to simple commands sent in the chat from a user. The message response can be in one of the following formats:
    
     - Welcome messages
     - Scheduled messages
     - Notifications
     
    This step-by-step guide helps you to send a proactive message from a bot. You'll see the following output:

    ## Take a tour of the source code

    Teams Toolkit provides components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the **EXPLORER** area of Visual Studio Code.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/proactive-scenario/file-structure.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the structure tab.":::

    The new project folder contains the following content:

    | Folder / File | Contents |
    | - | - |
    | `.vscode/` | Visual Studio Code files for debugging. |
    | `appManifest/` | Templates for the app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest). |
    | `env/`| Name / value pairs are stored in environment files and used by `teamsapp.yml` to customize the provisioning and deployment rules. |
    | `manifest.json` | App manifest for publishing through the Developer Portal for Teams is stored in `Properties/manifest.json`. |
    | `teamsapp.yml` | Main project file describes your app configuration and defines the set of actions to run in each lifecycle stage. |
    | `teamsapp.local.yml`| This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging. |    

- title: Deploy your Proactive message bot
  durationInMinutes: 1

    You've learnt to build and run Teams app with proactive message bot capability. Let's deploy the first app with proactive message bot capability on Azure using Teams Toolkit.

    ## Sign in to your Azure account

    Use your account to access the Microsoft Azure portal and provision new cloud resources to support your app.

    1. Open Visual Studio Code.
    1. Open the project folder where you created the proactive message bot app.
    1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the Visual Studio Code Activity Bar.
    1. Select **Sign in to Azure** using your credentials.

        > [!TIP]
        > If you have the AZURE ACCOUNT extension installed and are using the same account, you can skip this step.

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account.

    1. Close the browser when prompted and return to Visual Studio Code.

    The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar shows the two accounts separately. It also lists the number of usable Azure subscriptions available to you. Ensure that you have at least one usable Azure subscription available. If not, sign out and use a different account.

    ## Deploy your app to Azure

     Deployment consists of two steps. First, necessary cloud resources are created (also known as provisioning). Then, your app's code is copied into the created cloud resources. For this tutorial, you'll deploy the bot app.

     <br>
     <details>
     <summary>What's the difference between Provision and Deploy?</summary>
     <br>
     <b>Provision</b> creates resources in Azure and Microsoft 365 for your app, but no code (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is copied to the resources. <b>Deploy</b> copies the code for your app to the resources you created during provisioning. It's common to deploy multiple times without provisioning new resources. Since provisioning can take some time to complete, it's separate from deployment.

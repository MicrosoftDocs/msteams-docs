## Teams app features

| Feature | Description | Useful for |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Tabs | Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. You can add them as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user. | Personal tab, channel or group tab, Stage View, and link unfurling. |
| Bots | A bot, also known as a chatbot or conversational bot, has evolved with artificial intelligence to understand and respond to users in natural language for dynamic conversations. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation that provides access to services. | Customer service, content generation such as new sales presentations or code, personalized guidance for your app, complex financial analysis, and automation of tasks. |
| Message extension | Message extensions let the users interact with your web service Teams client. They search or start actions in an external system. You can send the result of the interaction to the Teams client as a richly formatted card. | Reserve a resource and allow the channel to know the reserved time slot. Search for a work item, and share it with the group as an Adaptive Card. Create a bug in your tracking system based on a Teams message, assign that bug to a user, and send a card to the conversation thread with the bug's details. |
| Meeting extensions | You can create apps to make meetings more productive. | Ask people to complete a survey during a call or send a quick reminder that doesnâ€™t interrupt the flow of the meeting. |
| Personal app | A personal app is a dedicated space (tab) or bot to help users focus on their own tasks or view activities important to them. | OneNote is a personal app that gives you a private workspace within Teams. Planner offers a bird's eye view of all your tasks, across boards that you or your team have added as channel tabs. |
| Webhooks and connectors | Communicate with external apps, and send or receive notifications and messages from other apps. | Subscribe to receive notifications and messages from your web services. |
| Microsoft Graph | Microsoft Graph APIs enable Teams apps to build collaborative features with the intelligence of Microsoft 365 data and engage users regularly through activity feed notifications. | Send activity feed notifications, export or import messages, get meeting transcripts and recordings, use resource-specific consent (RSC) permissions, CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) users, chats, channels, and apps. |
| Adaptive Card | Cards help you organize information into groups and give users the opportunity to interact with specific parts of the information. | Sharing using text and images; gathering information using input forms. |
| Dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) | Dialogs permit you to create modal pop-up experiences in your Teams application. | Run your own custom HTML or JavaScript code. Show an <`iframe`>-based widget such as a YouTube or Microsoft Stream video. |
| Copilot extensibility | The ability to customize and extend Microsoft 365 Copilot with additional knowledge and skills. Copilot agents help integrate your organization's knowledge, skills, and process automation into Microsoft 365 Copilot. | Generate unique insights and automate functions such as customer support, content creation, and data analysis using data specific to your organization. |

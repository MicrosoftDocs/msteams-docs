## Detailed Features of Teams Applications

Below is a rundown of some of the core features offered by Microsoft Teams, and how they can be utilized in your application development process:

- **Tabs:** These are Teams-aware webpages which can be embedded in Microsoft Teams. You can include them as part of a channel in a team, group chat, or within a personal app for individual users. They're useful for personal tabs, channel or group tabs, Stage View, and link unfurling.

- **Bots:** Bots, also known as chatbots, use artificial intelligence to understand and respond to users in natural language, facilitating dynamic conversations. They can be used in customer service, content generation, personalized guidance, complex financial analysis, and automated tasks.

- **Message Extensions:** These allow users to interact with your web service through the Teams client, enabling them to start actions in an external system. Message extensions are practicable for resource reservation, work item searches, creation of a bug tracking system based on Teams messages, and more.

- **Meeting Extensions:** By using these, you can create apps to make meetings more effective. For example, you can use them to ask attendees to complete a survey during a call, or to send reminders that donâ€™t disrupt the flow of the meeting.

- **Personal Apps:** Personal apps provide a dedicated space (tab) or bot to help users focus on their personal tasks or activities. They offer a private workspace within Teams, giving users an overview of all tasks across boards in a channel tab.

- **Webhooks and Connectors:** These facilitate communication with external apps, enabling you to send and receive notifications and messages from other apps.

- **Microsoft Graph:** This API enables Teams apps to build collaborative features, utilizing the intelligence of Microsoft 365 data and engaging users regularly through activity feed notifications.

- **Adaptive Cards:** These help to organize information into groups, providing users with interactive spaces for specific data parts. They're useful for sharing information using text and images, and gathering information through input forms.

- **Dialogs:** Also known as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x, these allow for the creation of modal pop-up experiences in your Teams application. They might contain custom HTML or JavaScript code, alongside an iframe-based widget, such as a YouTube or Microsoft Stream video.

- **Copilot Extensibility:** This functionality lets you customize and extend Microsoft 365 Copilot with your organization's knowledge and skillsets. Copilot extensibility is perfect for generating unique insights and automating functions like customer support, content creation, and data analysis.

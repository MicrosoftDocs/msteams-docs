| Tabs                            | Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded directly within Microsoft Teams. They can be integrated as part of a channel inside a team, in group chats, or as personal apps designed for individual users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Personal tabs, channel or group tabs, Stage View enhancements, and link unfurling to provide in-context information.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Bots                            | Bots, also known as chatbots or conversational agents, have evolved with artificial intelligence to understand and respond to user input in natural language. They can handle simple Q&A interactions or engage in complex conversations that interface with back-end services.                                                                                                                                              | Providing customer support, generating content such as sales presentations or code, offering personalized guidance within your app, conducting complex financial analyses, and automating various tasks.                                                                              |

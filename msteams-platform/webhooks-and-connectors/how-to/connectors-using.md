# Create and send messages

To create and send actionable messages, use either an Incoming Webhook or a Microsoft 365 connector. However, the actionable messages are accessible only to users with an Exchange Online license.

## Create actionable messages

The actionable messages include six visible buttons on the card. Each button is defined in the `potentialAction` property of the message by using `ActionCard` actions, each with an input type, a text field, a date picker, or a multiple-choice list. Each `ActionCard` has an associated action, for example `HttpPOST`.

The connector cards support the following actions:

* `ActionCard`: Presents one or more input types and associated actions.
* `HttpPOST`: Sends POST request to a URL.
* `OpenUri`: Opens URI in a separate browser or app. Optionally, targets different URIs based on operating systems.

The `ActionCard` action supports three input types:

* `TextInput`: A single line or multiline text field with an optional length limit.
* `DateInput`: A date selector with an optional time selector.
* `MultichoiceInput`: An enumerated list of choices offering either a single selection or multiple selections.

`MultichoiceInput` supports a `style` property that controls whether the list initially appears fully expanded. The default value of `style` depends on the value of `isMultiSelect` as follows:

| `isMultiSelect` | default `style` |
| --- | --- |
| `false` or not specified | `compact` |
| `true` | `expanded` |

To display the multiple-selection list in the compact style, specify `"isMultiSelect": true` and `"style": true`.

For more information on connector card actions, see [Actions](/outlook/actionable-messages/card-reference#actions).

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Specifying `compact` for the `style` property in Microsoft Teams is the same as specifying `normal` for the `style` property in Microsoft Outlook.
> * For the HttpPOST action, the bearer token is included with the requests. This token includes the Microsoft Entra identity of the Microsoft 365 user who took the action.

## Send a message through Incoming Webhook or connector for Microsoft 365 Groups

To send a message through your Incoming Webhook or connector for Microsoft 365 Groups, post a JSON payload to the webhook URL. This payload must be in the form of a [connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#connector-card-for-microsoft-365-groups).

You can also use this JSON to create cards containing rich inputs, such as text entry, multiselect, or selecting date and time. The code that generates the card and posts it to the webhook URL can run on any hosted service. These cards are defined as part of actionable messages and are also supported in [cards](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards.md) used in Teams bots and message extensions.

### Example of connector message

An example of connector message is as follows:

```json

    }]
}
```

## Send messages using cURL and PowerShell

# [cURL](#tab/cURL)

To post a message in the webhook with cURL, follow these steps:

1. Install cURL from [cURL website](https://curl.haxx.se/).

1. From the command line, enter the following cURL command:

   ```bash
   // on macOS or Linux
   curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"text": "Hello World"}' <YOUR WEBHOOK URL>
   ```

   ```bash
   // on Windows
   curl.exe -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d "{'text':'Hello World'}" <YOUR WEBHOOK URL>
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the POST succeeds, you must see a simple **1** output by `curl`.

1. Check the Teams client for the new card posted.

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

 Prerequisite: Installation of PowerShell and familiarization with its basic usage.

To post a message to the webhook with PowerShell, follow these steps:

1. From the PowerShell prompt, enter the following command:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-RestMethod -Method post -ContentType 'Application/Json' -Body '{"text":"Hello World!"}' -Uri <YOUR WEBHOOK URL>
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the POST succeeds, you must see a simple **1** output by `Invoke-RestMethod`.

1. Check the Teams channels associated with the webhook URL. You can see the new card posted to the channel.

## Send Adaptive Cards using an Incoming Webhook

> [!NOTE]
>
> * All native Adaptive Card schema elements, except `Action.Submit`, are fully supported.
> * The supported actions are [**Action.OpenURL**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.OpenUrl.html), [**Action.ShowCard**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.ShowCard.html), and [**Action.ToggleVisibility**](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.ToggleVisibility.html).

To send Adaptive Cards with text or a Base64 encoded image through an Incoming Webhook, follow these steps:

1. [Set up a custom webhook](~/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook.md) in Teams.
1. Create Adaptive Card JSON file using the following code:

# [Text](#tab/text1)

```json
    {
       "type":"message",
       "attachments":[
          {
             "contentType":"application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
             "contentUrl":null,
             "content":{
                "$schema":"http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
                "type":"AdaptiveCard",
                "version":"1.2",
                "body":[
                    {
                    "type": "TextBlock",
                    "text": "For Samples and Templates, see [https://adaptivecards.io/samples](https://adaptivecards.io/samples)"
                    }
                ]
             }
          }
       ]
    }
```

The properties for Adaptive Card JSON file are as follows:

* The `"type"` field must be `"message"`.
* The `"attachments"` array contains a set of card objects.
* The `"contentType"` field must be set to Adaptive Card type.
* The `"content"` object is the card formatted in JSON.

# [Base64 encoded image](#tab/image1)

```json
    {
      "type": "message",
      "attachments": [
        {
          "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
          "content": {
            "type": "AdaptiveCard",
            "body": [
              {
                "type": "Image",
                "url": "data&colon;image/jpeg;base64,/xxxxxxxx"
              }
            ],
            "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
            "version": "1.0"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
```

In this example, the image is included as an attachment of type `Image` with the URL set to the Base64 encoded image data. Ensure that you replace `/xxxxxxxx` with the actual Base64 encoded image data.

The properties for Adaptive Card JSON file are as follows:

* The `"type"` field must be `"message"`.
* The `"attachments"` array contains a set of card objects.
* The `"contentType"` field must be set to Adaptive Card type.
* The `"content"` object is the card formatted in JSON.

1. Test your Adaptive Card with Postman:

    1. Test the Adaptive Card using [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to send a POST request to the URL, created to set up Incoming Webhook.
    1. Paste the JSON file in the body of the request and view the Adaptive Card message in Teams.

> [!TIP]
> Use Adaptive Card [code samples and templates](https://adaptivecards.io/samples) to test the body of POST request.

## Rate limiting for connectors

Application rate limits control the traffic that a connector or an Incoming Webhook is permitted to generate on a channel. Teams tracks requests using a fixed rate window and incremental counter measured in seconds. If more than four requests are made in a second, the client connection is throttled until the window refreshes for the duration of the fixed rate.

### Transactions per second thresholds

The following table provides the time based transaction details:

| Time in seconds  | Maximum allowed requests  |
|---|---|
| 1   | 4  |  
| 30   | 60  |  
| 3600   | 100  |
| 7200 | 150  |
| 86400  | 1800  |

> [!NOTE]
> A [retry logic with exponential back-off](/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) can mitigate rate limiting for cases where requests are exceeding the limits within a second. Refer [HTTP 429 responses](../../bots/how-to/rate-limit.md#handle-http-429-responses) to avoid hitting the rate limits.

```csharp
// Please note that response body needs to be extracted and read 
// as Connectors do not throw 429s
try
{
    // Perform Connector POST operation     
    var httpResponseMessage = await _client.PostAsync(IncomingWebhookUrl, new StringContent(content));
    // Read response content
    var responseContent = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    if (responseContent.Contains("Microsoft Teams endpoint returned HTTP error 429")) 
    {
        // initiate retry logic
    }
}
```

These limits are in place to reduce spamming a channel by a connector and ensures an optimal experience to users.

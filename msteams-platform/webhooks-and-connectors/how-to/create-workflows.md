# Create workflows

Workflows in Teams are designed to optimize your routine tasks and processes by integrating with various workflow apps. They enable users to automate repetitive tasks or processes, thereby saving time and effort. The article guides you through the steps to incorporate, execute, and manage your workflows.

You can automate tasks using workflows if you're facing one or more of the following scenarios:

* Handling repetitive tasks within Teams.
* Alternating between Teams and other apps for updates or tasks.
* Transferring information from Teams to other applications.
* Preferring Teams notifications over email alerts.
* Posting the same questions Regularly in Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using connectors to automate repetitive tasks, we are transitioning to Workflow for more efficient automation.

## Add Workflows

If you're adding Workflows, the easiest way to get started is to browse the selection of pre-built workflows in the Apps section. When you're adding a workflow for the first time, the Workflows app first gets added in the Teams navigation pane and the workflow you selected is added in the respective scope.

To add a workflow:

1. In Teams, select the **Apps** :::image type="icon" source="../../assets/images/workflows/app icon.png" border="false"::: icon.

1. Select **Workflows**.

1. Select a workflow that interests you.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/workflows/select-workflow.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Workflows in the main window.":::

    If you're adding a workflow for the first time, the Workflows app dialog opens to install the app.

    Alternatively, you can select a suitable scope from the **Add** dropdown list.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/workflows/add-workflows-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to add Workflows app.":::

    After the app is added, the respective workflow dialog appears and validates the connections required for the workflow to function.

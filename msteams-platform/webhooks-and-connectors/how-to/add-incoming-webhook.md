# Create Incoming Webhooks

An Incoming Webhook lets external applications share content in Microsoft Teams channels. The webhooks are used as tools to track and notify. The webhooks provide a unique URL to send a JSON payload with a message in card format. Cards are user interface containers that include content and actions related to a single article. You can use cards in the following capabilities:

* Bots
* Message extensions
* Connectors

> [!NOTE]
>
> * The message size limit is 28 KB. When the size exceeds 28 KB, you receive an error. For more information, see [Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/limits-specifications-teams).
> * If more than four requests are made in a second, the client connection is throttled until the window refreshes for the duration of the fixed rate. A [retry logic with exponential backoff](/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) can mitigate rate limiting for cases where requests exceed the limits within a second. To avoid hitting the rate limits, see [HTTP 429 responses](../../bots/how-to/rate-limit.md#handle-http-429-responses).

## Key features of Incoming Webhooks

The following table provides the features and description of an Incoming Webhook:

| Features | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
|Adaptive Cards using an Incoming Webhook | Adaptive Cards can be sent through Incoming Webhooks. For more information, see [Send Adaptive Cards using Incoming Webhooks](../../webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using.md#send-adaptive-cards-using-an-incoming-webhook).|
|Actionable messaging support | Actionable message cards are supported in all Microsoft 365 groups including Teams. If you send messages through cards, you must use the actionable message card format. For more information, see [Legacy actionable message card reference](/outlook/actionable-messages/message-card-reference) and [message card playground](https://amdesigner.azurewebsites.net/).|
|Independent HTTPS messaging support|Cards provide information clearly and consistently. Any tool or framework that can send HTTPS POST requests can send messages to Teams through an Incoming Webhook.|
|Markdown support|All text fields in actionable messaging cards support basic Markdown. Don't use HTML markup in your cards. HTML is ignored and treated as plain text.|
|Scoped configuration|An Incoming Webhook is scoped and configured at the channel level.|
|Secure resource definitions|Messages are formatted as JSON payloads. This declarative messaging structure prevents the insertion of malicious code.|

<!--- TBD: A note should be short and eye-catching. No need to put a list item inside a Note or any admonition for that matter. Re-write the below list item.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Teams bots, message extensions, Incoming Webhook, and the Bot Framework support Adaptive Cards. Adaptive Card is an open cross-card platform framework that is used in all platforms such as Windows, Android, iOS, and so on. Currently, [Teams connectors](../../webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-creating.md) don't support Adaptive Cards. However, it is possible to create a [flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-flow-in-microsoft-teams/) that posts Adaptive Cards to a Teams channel.
> * For more information on cards and webhooks, see [Adaptive cards and Incoming Webhooks](~/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards.md#adaptive-cards-and-incoming-webhooks).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can build a notification bot Teams app using [Teams Toolkit](../../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md) other than an Incoming Webhook. They perform similarly but notification bot has more functionalities. For more information, see [Build notification bot with JavaScript](../../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml) or [Incoming Webhook notification sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx-Samples/tree/dev/incoming-webhook-notification).

You can create and send actionable messages through an Incoming Webhook or connector for Microsoft 365 Groups. For more information, see [create and send messages](~/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using.md).

> [!NOTE]
> In Teams, select **Settings** > **Member permissions** > **Allow members to create, update, and remove connectors**, so that any team member can add, modify, or delete a connector.

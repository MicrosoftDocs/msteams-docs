# ISV Outreach for those with O365 Connectors

I wanted to raise your awareness that Microsoft Teams is planning to retire its integration of Office 365 connectors in the coming months. There's a short writeup here explaining why our engineering team is making this change. In case you're not familiar with Office 365 connectors you can go to "manage channel" in Teams and then select edit connectors to see what is offered.
We saw about [number range] users leveraging the [ISVname] O365 connector and wanted to share a few suggestions on how you might be able to continue serving those customers at no cost once this technology gets retired fully on October 1st, 2024.

1. Create a Power Automate connector - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/developer/dev-enterprise-intro
Power Automate is the technology powering the popular "Workflows" app in Teams. It is the scalable and secure method we'll be recommending our customers use to relay information programmatically into and out of Teams. If you go this route we could even help create a workflow template or two for posting alerts from your product to Teams channels. This would make it very simple for users to adopt the new method.
1. Update your Teams app
Another option is invest further in your existing Teams app. For example, you could allow users to set up proactive messages based on trigger events in your system. Learn about how bots can post to channels proactively - Send and receive messages with a bot - Teams | Microsoft Learn
 
Since Office 365 connectors will be disabled completely by September 30th, please let me know if you have any questions or we can support you in any investments over the coming months.

| Gap | Impact or Customer Feedback | Work to Close this Gap | Dependency | Next Steps + Notes |
|-----|--------------------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------|
| Workflows bot cannot yet post to private channels | High - Breaks functionality. High customer feedback indicates that migrating will disrupt notifications within Private Channels as Workflows is not supported within Private Channels. This is a large migration blocker for our customers. | Yes | TACO team - Private Channels (PM POC: Jason Lewis) <br> App Platform team - Enable apps/bots within Shared Channels (LWG) (PM POC: Suyash Kumar Tiwari) | Taco is migrating Private Channels architecture to Shared Channels, where bot posting will be supported. <br> **Two parts to close this gap**: <br> 1. Shared Channel infrastructure (LWG) supports app platform + bots. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETA: This semester FY25H1 <br> 2. Private Channels move to LWG. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETA: End of CY2024 / Beginning of CY2025 <br> Jason working on a GTM plan (check the week of August 6, 2024). <br> Post-LWG work, partner with Suyash and team to ensure bot readiness once the change fully rolls out. |
| Workflows cannot post messages using the payload/format of O365 Connectors | High - 90% of current O365 webhooks use the legacy Message Card formatting. High customer feedback indicates that switching from Message Card to Adaptive Cards takes time, especially with hundreds of webhooks. Not all 3P services post Adaptive Cards and only support Message Card format, breaking functionality. | Yes | No current dependencies. Low Code team is handling this work. <br> PM POC: Connor Rodewald <br> Dev POC: Alex Waibel | Alex estimates enabling Message Card posting will take ~1.5 months. ETA: End of August. <br> Feature [3947577](https://visualstudio.com) - Enable MessageCards to be posted by bot. <br> Customers will need to update the URL to the Power Automate one provided; no payload change needed. |
| Currently Workflows is not in GCCH | High - Impacts all GCCH customers using O365 Connectors as there's no comparable offering within Workflows. | Yes | No current dependencies. Low Code team is handling this work. <br> PM POC: Connor Rodewald <br> Dev POC: Luis Torres | Luis from Adrian/Dileepa's team will start closing GCCH gaps in mid-August. <br> Feature [3866465](https://visualstudio.com) - Workflows in GCCH. <br> Initial GCCH features will include workflow creation from Chat/Channel entry points. GCCH currently only supports Webhooks. |
| Workflows are tied to individuals while O365 Connectors are tied to the Teams team/channel | High - The change from M365 group/Teams team ownership to user ownership causes issues if the user leaves the company, leading to flow deletion. Customers need service accounts to maintain critical workflows. | No | No dependencies; this is a structural aspect of Power Automate. | Power Automate architecture ties flows to users. Workarounds involve creating Service/Utility accounts. Future security updates might affect this model, potentially resolving the gap. |
| Workflows are missing some connectors (Jenkins, DataDog, etc.) | Medium - ~9% of users use O365 Connectors without a comparable connector in Power Automate. | Yes | Ecosystem team collaboration. <br> POC: Trent Hazy | Trent is working with the ecosystem team to create comparable connectors for Power Automate. |
| Ability to create a workflow in another environment but default | Medium - Customers need to create workflows in specific environments other than the default tenant environment. | Yes | Power Automate <br> POC: Kelli Waiss <br> Dev: TBD | Power Automate needs to add the ability to filter personal apps and create workflows in non-default environments. |
| Moving users to premium connectors | Medium - Users need to purchase additional licenses for connectors that were free with O365 Connectors. Currently, ~2% of users are affected. This number may increase as more ISVs build connectors. | No | No current dependency. Reconnect with Power Automate marketing if needed. | Premium connectors like Jira and ADO require upgraded licenses. Initial conversations with the Power Automate team did not lead to moving connectors to the standard/free SKU. |
| Messages from Workflows webhooks unable to have a custom icon/name | Low - Custom names and icons for posts will not work in Workflows. Minimal user feedback received. | No | No dependencies. | Continue monitoring user feedback. Creating a request for custom icons/names would require changes to the bot service. |

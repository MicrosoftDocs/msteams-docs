    The workflow bot allows users to interact with an Adaptive Card enabled by the Adaptive Card action handler feature in the workflow bot app. When you respond to the triggered Adaptive Card action, then a sequential workflow is completed.
    When you get an Adaptive Card, it provides one or more buttons in the card for your input. You can also call an API, and then send another Adaptive Card in your conversation in response to the card action.
    In this tutorial, you'll learn:
      * How to build workflow bot with Teams Toolkit.
      * About the directory structure of your app.
    
    You can see the following output:

    ### Take tour of source code
    Teams Toolkit provides components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code for JavaScript/TypeScript.

    The created bot is a normal TeamsFx project that contains following folders:
    
    | Folder / File | Contents |
    | - | - |
    | `teamsapp.yml` | Main project file describes your application configuration and defines the set of actions to run in each lifecycle stages. |
    | `teamsapp.local.yml`| This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging. |
    | `env/`| Name / value pairs are stored in environment files and used by `teamsapp.yml` to customize the provisioning and deployment rules. |
    | `.vscode/` | VSCode files for debugging. |
    | `appPackage/` | Templates for the Teams application manifest. |
    | `infra/` | Templates for provisioning Azure resources. |
    | `src/` | The source code for the application. |
    | `src/index.js`| Application entry point and `restify` handlers for the Workflow bot. |
    | `src/teamsBot.js` | An empty teams activity handler for bot customization. |
    | `src/commands/helloworldCommandHandler.js` | Implementation that handles responding to a chat command. |
    | `src/adaptiveCards/helloworldCommandResponse.json` | Defines the Adaptive Card (UI) that is displayed in response to a chat command. |
    | `src/adaptiveCards/doStuffActionResponse.json` | A generated Adaptive Card that is sent to Teams for the response of "doStuff" action. |
    | `src/cardActions/doStuffActionHandler.js` | Implements the handler for the `doStuff` button displayed in the Adaptive Card. |

    You can interact with the bot in Teams by sending a helloWorld command.
    
    :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/sbs-workflow-bot-action-response.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selection to add your workflow bot app.":::

    You'll receive the following command response in Adaptive Card:

     :::image type="content" source="./assets/images/sbs-workflow-bot/sbs-workflow-bot-debug-output1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selection to add your workflow bot app.":::
    
    Then you can select the **DoStuff** button to invoke the action, that responds with the following updated Adaptive Card:

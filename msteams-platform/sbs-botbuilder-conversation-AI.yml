   |[Microsoft 365 developer account](concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md)| Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |


   ## Prepare development environment

   After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.


   ### Install the Teams Toolkit

   The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
   You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, or CLI (command-line interface), called `TeamsFx`.


   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

   1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
   1. In the search box, enter **Teams toolkit**.
   1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

      :::image type="content" source="assets/images/bots/Teams-AI-library-ttk-install.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams Toolkit extension Install option in Visual Studio Code.":::

   The Teams Toolkit icon :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png" border="false"::: appears in the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar** after it's installed.

   You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

   > [!NOTE]
   > The latest version of Teams Toolkit is 5.0.0.

   # [Command line](#tab/cli)

   To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

   ``` bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

   ``` bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

   Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

   You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell.

   ---

   ## Set up your Teams development tenant

   A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where your sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

   ### Check for sideloading option

   After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you can't preview and test your app in Teams locally.

   Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

   Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="assets/images/bots/Teams-AI-library-upload-a-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Upload a custom app option in Teams desktop client.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you don't see the option **Upload a custom app**, talk to your Teams administrator.

   ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

   If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
   1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
   1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
   1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

       :::image type="content" source="assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Microsoft":::

   1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.  

   Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to do first.

- title: Create project workspace for your bot app
  durationInMinutes: 1

    Let's create your first bot app.
    
    The bot capability of a Teams app creates a chatbot or a conversational bot. You use it to run simple and automated tasks, like providing customer service. A bot talks with a web service and helps you use its offerings. You can get weather forecast, make reservations, or any other service offered using a conversational bot.

    :::image type="content" source="assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-bot/your-helloworld-app-bot.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. Bot is highlighted.":::
    
    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the bot app.

    In this tutorial, you learn:

    ## Update your bot app with Conversational AI capabilities

    Teams Toolkit is the easiest way to scaffold and get a bot running, Teams Toolkit creates the basic bot structure for you so that you can  get started with configuring your bot. 
    
    Let's get started to configure Teams AI library capabilities.

    1. Go to Visual Studio Code and open a terminal window.
    
    1. Run the following command in the terminal to add the latest version of the Teams AI library to your application using npm:

       ```bash
       npm install @microsoft/botbuilder-m365

       ```

    1. Go to the **env** folder and update the Open AI key in the `.env.local.user`file.

       ```
        SECRET_BOT_PASSWORD=
        SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
       ```

    1. Go to the `config.ts` file and add the following code:
    
       ```typescript
       openAIKey: process.env.SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY
       ```

       When you debug the app, the Open AI key defined here process the Open AI key from the `.env.local.user` during local debug.

    1. Go to the `teamsapp.local.yml`file and add the following code after `BOT_ID` and `BOT_PASSWORD`:

       ```teamsapp.local.yml
       SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY}}
       ```

       When you run the app locally, the Open AI key defined here is used in the local settings.

    1. Go to the `index.ts` file, and add the following code:

        1. Add the following code to import Teams AI library:

            ```typescript
            import { Application, ConversationHistory, DefaultPromptManager, DefaultTurnState, OpenAIModerator, OpenAIPlanner, AI } from '@microsoft/botbuilder-m365';
            import path from "path";
            ```

            You need to import the required classes to use the functions and variables available in the class to build your app. You can leverage pre-built templates, and simply add your business logic to this scaffold.

        1. Add the following code in the `index.ts` file to define a state:

            ```typescript
            // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
            interface ConversationState {}
            type ApplicationTurnState = DefaultTurnState<ConversationState>;
            ```

            The `ApplicationTurnState` performs flow of the arbitrary data in the entire bot application.
        
        1. Add the following code to create planner, moderator, and promptManager:

            ```typescript
            // Create AI components
            const planner = new OpenAIPlanner({
              apiKey: config.openAIKey,
              defaultModel: 'text-davinci-003',
              logRequests: true
            });
            const moderator = new OpenAIModerator({
              apiKey: config.openAIKey,
              moderate: 'both'
            });
            const promptManager = new DefaultPromptManager(path.join(__dirname, './prompts' ));
            ````
            * Planner: The `OpenAIPlanner` is a class that implements an interface called `Planner`. The Planner calls the OpenAI's LLM model 'text-davinci-003' for text completion. You can use the `OpenAIPlanner` or AzureOpenAIPlanner. If your using the AzureOpenAIPlanner, ensure that you define the endpoint property.

            * PromptManager: `promptManager` Allows you to register your prompts, load a prompt template into the AI component. All the functions related to the prompt manager are available in the `DefaultPromptManager`.  The prompt manager parses the prompts defined in the `prompt` folder. You can replace or override your own functionality in the prompt manager. 

            * Moderator: The `OpenAIModerator` reviews both user's input and the model output to detect harmful speech, such as hate speech, self-harm, and violence.


        1. Add the following code to define storage and application:

            ```typescript
            // Define storage and application
            const storage = new MemoryStorage();
            const app = new Application<ApplicationTurnState>({
              storage,
              ai: {
                  planner,
                  moderator,
                  promptManager,
                  prompt: 'chat',
                  history: {
                      assistantHistoryType: 'text'
                  }
              }
            });
            ```

            * The `Application` class replaces the Teams Activity Handler class from Bot Framework SDK. The application class has all the information and bot logic required for an app. You can register actions or activity handlers for the app in this class.
            * The `MemoryStorage` class is a memory based storage provider that stores and retrieves plan old JSON objects. It's imported from the Bot Builder SDK.


            1. Under **Import required bot service**, add `MemoryStorage`.

        1.  Add the following code to define actions:

            ```typescript
            app.ai.action(AI.FlaggedInputActionName, async (context, state, data) => {
                await context.sendActivity(`I'm sorry your message was flagged: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
                return false;
            });

            app.ai.action(AI.FlaggedOutputActionName, async (context, state, data) => {
                await context.sendActivity(`I'm not allowed to talk about such things.`);
                return false;
            });
            ```
            
            When the `OpenAIModerator` reviews and identifies a flag in an input or output, it triggers the action `AI.FlaggedInputActionName` or `AI.FlaggedOutputActionName` and the `context.sendActivity` sends a message to the user. If the user receives a message for an flagged  input or output, the user can control what he wants to do.

        1. Add the following code to define history:

            ```typescript
            app.message('/history', async (context, state) => {
            const history = ConversationHistory.toString(state, 2000, '\n\n');
            await context.sendActivity(history);
            });
            ```

           The `ConversationHistory` class is a utility class that makes it easier to manage the conversation history. When the user sends '/history' to the bot in Teams, the server sends a log of the conversation history back to the user. The history is tracked and populated in the state.temp.history property where state is the `ApplicationTurnState`.

        1. By default Bot builder uses `bot` as a variable, since we're constructing an app for the `new Application`. We need to replace `await bot.run(context)` with `await app.run(context)`.
   
    1. In the root folder, create a new folder **prompts/chat**.

    1. Under **chat**, create the following files:
       * config.json
       * skprompt.txt

    1. Go to the `config.json` file, and add the following code to create the prompt model settings:
    
        ```javascript
        {
            "schema": 1,
            "description": "Chat with Teams Chef",
            "type": "completion",
            "completion": {
            "max_tokens": 150,
            "temperature": 0.9,
            "top_p": 0.0,
            "presence_penalty": 0.6,
            "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
            "stop_sequences": [
                "Human:",
                "AI:"
            ]
            }
        }
        ```

        The `config.json` is initiated by the `DefaultPromptManager` from the `index.ts` file. When a prompt is initiated, the prompt manager searches for  the prompt config file (chat/config.json) and passed the prompt settings into Open AI or Azure Open AI.

    1. Go to the 'prompt.txt' file and add the following instructions for GPT on how the bot should conduct itself and facilitate conversation:

        ```text
        The following is a conversation with an AI assistant, its name is Teams Chef. 
        Teams Chef is an expert in Microsoft Teams apps development and the Human is junior developer learning Microsoft Teams development for the first time. 
        Teams Chef should always reply by explaining new concepts in simple terms using cooking as parallel concepts. 
        Teams Chef should always greet the human, ask them their name, and then guide the junior developer in their journey to build new apps for Microsoft Teams.
        ```

        The `prompt.txt` file contains text prompts with which the users interact with OpenAI endpoint. OpenAI endpoint attempts to use these prompts to produce the next series of words that are most likely to follow from the previous text.

        To store and leverage session history, add the following in the 'prompt.txt' file:

        ```
        {{$history}}
        Human: {{$input}}
        TeamsChef:
        ```

        The {{$history}} variable gets its value from the state.temp.history property and the {{$input}} variable gets its value from state.temp.input where state is the `ApplicationTurnState`.

        The prompt template is populated using the {{$history}}} variable. The `$history` variable remembers the list of entries provided by the user and the model. 

        For example, let's say the user's name is "Dave". The bot might carry on the following conversation:

        ```
        AI: Hi there! My name is Teams Chef. It's nice to meet you. What's your name?
        DAVE: My name is Dave.
        AI:Hi Dave! It's great to meet you. Let me help you get started with Microsoft Teams app development. Have you ever cooked before?
        DAVE: No, not yet, why?
        AI: Cooking is a great way to learn how to develop apps for Microsoft Teams. Just like cooking, developing apps requires you to have the right ingredients and tools, and to follow a set of instructions. It also requires creativity and problem-solving skills. So, let's get started! What would you like to learn first?
        DAVE: Which kind of apps can I build for Microsoft Teams?
        AI: Great question! You can build various apps for Microsoft Teams, including bots, messaging extensions, tabs, and connectors. Bots are like the main course of your app - they provide the core functionality. Messaging extensions are like side dishes - they add extra features to your app. Tabs are like garnishes - they provide additional information or visuals. And connectors are like spices - they allow you to integrate with other services.
        ```
        Notice that the bot remembered Dave's first message when responding to the second.
         
    This sample leverages OpenAI endpoint for all its natural language modelling, the user can talk to an AI bot in any language of their choosing. The bot understands and responds appropriately without extra code.

    ## Build and run your first bot app locally

    To build and run your app in the local environment:

    1. Select **F5** in Visual Studio Code to run your app in debug mode.

    Let's deploy the first app with Bot capability on Azure using Teams Toolkit.

    ## Sign in to your Azure account

    Use this account to access the Microsoft Azure portal and to provision new cloud resources to support your app.

    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/viscode)

    1. Open Visual Studio Code.
    1. Open the project folder in which you created the tab app.
    1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png" border="false"::: icon in the sidebar.
    1. Select **Sign in to Azure**.

        > [!TIP]
        > If you have the Azure Account extension installed and are using the same account, you can skip this step. Use the same account as you're using in other extensions.

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account.
    1. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials.
    1. Close the browser when prompted and return to Visual Studio Code.

        The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar shows the two accounts separately. It also lists the number of usable Azure subscriptions available to you. Ensure you have at least one usable Azure subscription available. If not, sign out and use a different account.

        Now you're ready to deploy your app to Azure!

        Congratulations, you have created a Teams app! 
        Now let's go ahead and learn how to deploy one of the apps to Azure using the Teams Toolkit.

    # [Command line](#tab/cline)

    1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login m365
        ```

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

    2. Sign in to Azure with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash

    ## Deploy your app to Azure

    Deployment consists of two steps. First, necessary cloud resources are created (also known as provisioning). Then, your app's code is copied into the created cloud resources. For this tutorial, you'll deploy the tab app.

    What's the difference between Provision and Deploy?

    The Provision step creates resources in Azure and Microsoft 365 for your app, but no code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) is copied to the resources. The Deploy step copies the code for your app to the resources you created during the provision step. It's common to deploy multiple times without provisioning new resources. Since the provision step can take some time to complete, it's separate from the deployment step.
    
    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/viscode2)
   
    1. Select the Teams Toolkit :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png" border="false"::: icon in the Visual Studio Code sidebar.

    1. Select **Provision in the Cloud**.
    
        :::image type="content" source="assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/provisioning-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of provision in the cloud under Teams toolkit.":::

    1. Select a subscription to use for the Azure resources. Your app is hosted using Azure resources.
    
    :::image type="content" source="assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/select-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the subscription to use for the Azure resources.":::

       A dialog warns you that costs may be incurred when running resources in Azure.

    1. Select **Provision**.

       The provisioning process creates resources in the Azure cloud. It may take some time. You can monitor the progress by watching the dialogs in the bottom-right corner. After a few minutes, you see the following notice:
       If you want, you can view the provisioned resources. For this tutorial, you don't need to view resources.
       The provisioned resource appears in the Environment section.

       :::image type="content" source="assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/deploy-provision-successmsgext.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a notice which displays 'hellomsg' successfully provisioned in the cloud.":::

    1. Select Deploy to the Cloud from the Deployment panel after provisioning is complete.

       :::image type="content" source="assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/deploy-cloud.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing deploy to cloud.":::

       As with provisioning, deployment takes some time. You can monitor the process by watching the dialogs in the bottom-right corner. After a few minutes, you see a completion notice.

    Now, you can use the same process to deploy your Bot and Message Extension apps to Azure.

    ## Run the deployed app
    
    Once the provisioning and deployment steps are complete:

    1. Open the debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D / ⌘⇧-D or View > Run) from Visual Studio Code.

    1. Select Launch Remote (Edge) from the launch configuration drop-down.

    1. Select the Start debugging (F5) to launch your app from Azure.

    1. Select Add.
    
       The toolkit displays a message to indicate that the app is added to Teams.
       * If you select Got it, you can try the app later from the list of Sideloaded apps.
       * If you select Try it, Teams loads your app.

    Your app is loaded on the Azure site.

    1. Select Try it.

    The Message Extension app is loaded in a chat bot app.

    <details>
    <summary>Learn what happens when you deployed your app to Azure</summary>

    Before deployment, the application has been running locally:

     * The backend runs using **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
     * The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

    Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription, and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code for the application to Azure.

     * The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services, including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
     * The frontend application is deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.

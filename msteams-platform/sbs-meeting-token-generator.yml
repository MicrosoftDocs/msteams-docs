    The Meeting token app helps to enhance your meeting experience in Teams by allowing meeting participants to request for token and generate tokens. The app generates tokens sequentially so that each participant has an equal opportunity to interact in the meeting. For example, the app is useful in Q&A sessions and in meetings, such as scrum meetings.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The In-meeting tabs for Meeting token generator app are available only for Teams desktop client.

    **Key features of Meeting token generator**

    * Displays the current token used in the meeting.
    * Displays the user list sorted based on the token number.
    * Generates a token for the user upon request.
    * Displays current user's token number.
    * Allows the organizer to skip the current meeting token.

    **Different ways of user interactions**

    * Token: Requests token for the user.
    * Done: Confirms token generation for the user.
    * Skip: Skips the current user and moves to the next person in line for a token.

      > [!NOTE]
      > Skip is available only to the meeting organizers.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to generate meeting token for all the participants to interact in the meeting. You'll see the following output:

   You install the following tools and set up your development environment: 

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call-all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK version 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. If you haven't installed the .NET 3.1 (or later) SDK globally, the portable version can be installed. |
     | &nbsp; | [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm devDependencies). |
           
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).
    
    You must have working knowledge of the following technologies:

    * [C#](/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/tutorials/how-to-display-command-line-arguments)

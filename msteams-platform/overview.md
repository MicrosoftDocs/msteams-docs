# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams provides a wide collection of apps developed by Microsoft as well as external service providers. These Teams apps can take on various forms such as tabs, bots, message extensions, or even a hybrid of these capabilities. Additionally, you have the option to extend these Teams apps to work on Outlook and the broader Microsoft 365 app ecosystem, thereby enhancing the collaborative experience for users.

Apps on Teams can be designed for personal use or for shared collaboration. A personal app is tailored for one-on-one interactions, whereas a shared app creates a common space where multiple users can collaborate effectively.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Effective collaboration and communication lie at the heart of any thriving organization. Apps integrated within Teams offer concise communication, seamless integration with essential services, and on-the-go accessibility. These features are why organizations are increasingly relying on apps to drive their operations.

Organizations use Teams apps to:
- Connect with their customers,
- Provide streamlined services,
- Share crucial information, and
- Foster environments where teams can collaborate in real time.

A well-placed app facilitates a cohesive environment that meets both external and internal business needs.

Let's explore some areas where a Teams app can help meet specific business objectives:

You can build apps with the Teams platform by extending existing capabilities to better fit your organizational needs. Whether you choose to create a brand-new app for Teams or integrate an existing one, you can capitalize on the powerful features of the platform.

Take a look at these example developer personas and app scenarios:

These scenarios demonstrate that Teams apps can address a range of business activities and enhance collaboration across Microsoft 365.

## Build Apps With Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps significantly boost productivity in a collaborative workspace by centralizing key information, essential tools, and trusted processes in the place where people work, learn, and connect daily. By extending the capabilities of the Teams platform, you can either create something entirely new or integrate an existing app, thus meeting your unique business requirements.

The benefits of building Teams apps range from aligning with organizational goals to enhancing internal productivity. Here are several reasons why Teams is ideally suited for your app development needs:

* **Communication and Collaboration**

    Teams apps succeed by drawing information from external systems, facilitating discussions, and enabling users to take actionable steps—all within the Teams client. For instance, you can design an app that automatically pushes notifications to a targeted audience when an external event occurs, ensuring everyone remains informed.

* **Social Interactions**

    Since Teams is inherently a social platform, custom apps focused on social engagement encourage team members to extend company culture into the digital workspace. You can develop apps that:
    - Send automatic polls to gather opinions,
    - Allow users to share real-time feedback, or
    - Enhance connectivity and communication between team members.

* **Common Business Processes**

    Many organizations face regular, repetitive tasks such as:
    - Creating and sharing sales call reports,
    - Tracking project timelines,
    - Reserving shared resources,
    - Submitting help desk requests, and
    - Managing expense reports.
    
    Building a Teams app to handle these processes can streamline operations by automating tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing manual errors.

* **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots**

    Teams offers versatile one-to-one conversational bots, which are among its most open-ended features. These bots engage directly with users and can include dialogs (referred to as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) to simplify complex information. For example:
    - If your app is a design tool that involves collaboration among multiple users, a shared bot can send notifications and updates to boost user engagement.
    - A chat bot might serve as an efficient alternative to traditional emails or phone calls for contacting IT or HR departments.

* **Surface Existing App**

    If you already have a web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or any other web-based application, consider integrating it into Teams. Extending your existing applications to run within Teams can:
    - Expand your user base,
    - Enhance engagement,
    - Leverage a familiar interface for users, and
    - Streamline the integration of interactive functionalities.

* **Teams Store Advantage**

    Publishing your app on the Teams Store can significantly boost its discovery and adoption. This exposure works as a marketing opportunity by:
    - Increasing the availability of your app,
    - Enhancing your product’s awareness, and
    - Reaching a broader audience—making it an excellent platform for startups and established companies alike.

* **Build Once, Run Everywhere**

    With the Teams platform, you can enjoy a streamlined approach to delivering cross-platform apps across Microsoft 365. By utilizing a single codebase, you can create tailored app experiences for:
    - Teams,
    - Outlook,
    - Microsoft 365 apps, and more.

    This approach means that end users can access your app without leaving their work context, and administrators benefit from a simplified management and deployment process. By using the latest app manifest standards and the Teams JavaScript client library, your personal tab and message extension apps can run not only in Teams but also in other Microsoft 365 environments, significantly broadening your app’s reach.

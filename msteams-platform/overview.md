# Teams Apps That Fit

Microsoft Teams offers a variety of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can function as tabs, bots, message extensions, or a combination of these capabilities. Teams apps can also extend to Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, enhancing the Teams collaborative experience for users.

- **Personal Apps**: Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps**: Allow multiple users to collaborate in a shared space.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are essential for any organization. Apps facilitate:

- Concise communication.
- Integration with necessary services.
- On-the-go accessibility.

Organizations use apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information, thereby building a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs.

Here are some ways apps meet business needs:

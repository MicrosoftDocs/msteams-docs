# The Microsoft Teams developer platform

Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace in Office 365 that integrates with the apps and services that people use to get work done together. The Microsoft Teams developer platform makes it easy to integrate your own services with Teams, whether you develop custom apps for your enterprise or SaaS applications for teams around the world.

> [!TIP]
> Don't have Microsoft Teams? Get a free Office 365 developer subscription or activate Teams for your existing Office 365 account. See [Set up your Office 365 tenant](~/get-started/get-started-tenant).

Using the Teams developer platform, you can create two classes of apps:

- Apps that any organization using Office 365 can access via the Teams Store.
- Apps that you publish to your tenant’s Teams App Catalog that’s only available to your organization. These are known as *line-of-business* apps.

The key concepts and guidance for developers are applicable to both classes of apps, except you go through a formal submission process to  [publish apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/publishing/apps-publish#appsource). For information about the benefits of creating apps for your tenant’s Teams App Catalog, see the [Line-of-business apps overview](~/lob-apps-value-prop) page.

## Apps in Microsoft Teams

To extend Microsoft Teams you create a Microsoft Teams app&mdash;a package of capabilities that you host and that can be distributed through Microsoft Teams or installed by individual teams.

To learn about Teams apps and all the possibilities they offer, see [Develop apps for Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/apps/apps-overview).

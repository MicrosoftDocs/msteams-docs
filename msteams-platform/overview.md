# API Documentation for Teams Apps

## Authentication

Every request to our API needs to be authenticated. We use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication. You will need to provide an access_token in the Authorization header for each request.

## Endpoints 

We have various API endpoints that you can use to interact with Teams Apps. Below are the main endpoints:

### Get Teams Apps

The Get Teams Apps endpoint can be used to retrieve information about all Teams Apps.

- Endpoint: `/api/teamsapps`
- Method: `GET`
- Status Codes: `200 OK`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`

### Create Teams Apps

You can use this endpoint to create a new Teams App.

- Endpoint: `/api/teamsapps`
- Method: `POST`
- Status Codes: `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`

### Update Teams Apps

This endpoint allows you to update an existing Teams App.

- Endpoint: `/api/teamsapps/{appId}`
- Method: `PUT`
- Status Codes: `200 OK`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`

### Delete Teams Apps

You can delete an existing Teams App using this endpoint.

- Status Codes: `204 No Content`, `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`

## Request and Response Format

Requests and responses are formatted as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Below is an example of a request to the Create Teams Apps endpoint:

```json
{
  "name": "Sample App",
  "description": "This is a sample app.",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Here's an example of a standard response:

```json
{
  "app_id": "123",
  "name": "Sample App",
  "description": "This is a sample app.",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an HTTP status code indicating the type of error. The body of the response includes more details about the error.

Here's an example of an error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid data."
}
```

## Examples and Use Cases

To demonstrate how the API can be used, here are some practical examples:

- You can use the Get Teams Apps endpoint to retrieve information about all Teams Apps. This can be useful, for example, if you want to display a list of available apps in a user interface.
  
- If you want to add a new Teams App, you can use the Create Teams App endpoint. You just need to provide the necessary information in the request body, such as the name and description of the new app.
  
- To update an app, you can use the Update Teams Apps endpoint. Just provide the new information in the request body and include the app's ID in the URL.
  
- If you want to delete an app, you can use the Delete Teams Apps endpoint. You only need to include the app's ID in the URL.

Please make sure the request and response examples are well-formatted and that there are no syntax errors in the JSON.

# Building Apps that Fit with Teams 

Microsoft Teams offers an array of apps from Microsoft and third-party providers. Teams apps can manifest as tabs, bots, or message extensions, and they can be configured to work with Outlook and Microsoft 365 too. These apps enrich the user experience by expanding the collaboration potential of Teams.

Apps can be designed for personal or shared use. Personal apps facilitate one-on-one communication, while shared apps provide a space for multiple users to work together.

## Meeting Organizational Objectives with Apps

Collaboration and communication are pivotal to a successful organization. The integration across multiple services and the ability to access services on-the-go are important reasons why organizations increasingly rely on apps. 

Apps can be used to engage with customers, provide services, and disseminate information. Beyond these uses, apps can serve as collaborative spaces where people come together to work. A well-developed app can enhance both external and internal business processes.

App benefits highlighted in the diagram below include:

| **Development Options** | **Business Opportunities** |
| --- | --- |
| - Desktop app <br> - Web app <br> - Mobile app | - Increase user engagement <br> - Improve app discovery through Microsoft Teams Store |
| **Customer Benefits** | **Internal Workflows** |
| - Accessibility <br> - Secure customer data <br> - Streamlined communication | - Automate repetitive tasks <br> - Simplify tasks with bots (e.g., Q&A, helpdesk) |

Teams platform enables you to develop apps with extended features to suit specific needs. You could innovate a brand new Teams app or integrate an existing app.

Consider the following developer personas and app scenarios:

Your Teams apps can meet these scenarios and enhance collaboration within Teams across your Microsoft 365 environments.

## Enhancing Productivity with Teams Apps 

Teams apps enhance productivity by delivering key information, common tools, and trusted processes to collaborative workspaces. The benefits of building apps with Teams range from meeting organizational goals to improving internal productivity.

Here's why Teams is your go-to platform for app development:

* **Communication and Collaboration:** Successful Teams apps typically pull in data from another system, facilitate a conversation about it, and allow users to take action. This can all be accomplished directly within the Teams client. In response to an event or action in an external system, you can push information to a target audience.

* **Social Interactions:** Teams provides a social platform that can be used to extend your company culture into the digital workspace. Create apps for polls, share feedback, connect and communicate with each other.

* **Automation of Business Processes:** Repetitive tasks like creating and sharing reports, tracking project timelines, reserving resources, and filing help desk requests can be automated through Teams apps.

* **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots:** One-to-one conversational bots are a high potential feature in Teams. The conversation between the bot and user can be made more interactive by including dialogs or task modules. A shared bot could notify all users in a design tool app, for instance, promoting user engagement. Chat bots can also replace emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments.

* **Surface Existing App:** If you already have a web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based application, you could integrate it into Teams. This increases your user base and engagement for your app.

* **Teams Store Advantage:** Featuring your app on the Teams Store can allure more users your way. Teams platform also functions as a marketing tool for startups, increasing awareness of your products. 

* **Build Once, Run Everywhere:** Extending your Teams app across Microsoft 365 environments consolidates your management and deployment workflow. Apps can be tailored for Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 through a single codebase. This approach broadens the reach of your app and streamlines your development and distribution processes.

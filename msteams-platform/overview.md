# Microsoft Teams Developer Platform Overview

The Microsoft Teams platform empowers developers to create intelligent and collaborative experiences directly within the Teams environment. By building agents and apps, developers can achieve organizational goals, boost productivity, and foster collaboration. The platform also enables seamless integration across Microsoft 365 services.

## What is the Teams Platform?

Teams is evolving from a communication hub into a collaborative and intelligent platform where people, data, and AI converge. Developers can build agents using the Teams SDK, enabling natural, conversational, and context-aware experiences powered by large language models (LLMs). Additionally, developers can create Teams apps to extend capabilities for task-specific workflows, data visualization, and integration with enterprise systems.

### Developer Personas and Scenarios

Developers can enhance collaboration using Teams agents or apps through various scenarios tailored to different personas.

## Why Build on the Teams Platform?

The Teams platform, with over 320 million monthly active users, provides tools to extend Teams with seamless, secure, and contextual solutions. It facilitates communication and integrates agents and apps across Microsoft 365 platforms.

### Key Roles of Agents in Teams

- **Collaboration and Communication**: Agents facilitate concise interactions, integrating with essential services and providing accessibility.
- **Business Enablement**: Agents streamline workflows and simplify processes like Q&A, helpdesk, and approvals.
- **Secure Interaction**: Agents ensure secure data handling and personalized experiences.

Agents can be deployed across desktop, web, and mobile platforms to increase user engagement, surface key information, and automate processes.

### Extend and Scale Agents

Agents can consolidate existing web apps, SharePoint sites, PowerApps, and other solutions into Teams, expanding reach and engagement. Publishing agents to the Teams Store increases visibility and adoption. Developers can build a unified experience for agents, deploying them across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 using a single codebase.

### Social Interactions and Personal Apps

Teams acts as a social platform where custom apps help extend company culture. Personal apps use conversational bots for direct user interaction, and task modules make complex data easy to manage.

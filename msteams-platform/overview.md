## Introduction

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can take the form of tabs, bots, or message extensions, or an integration of several capabilities, thereby enhancing the collaborative experience for users. You can also extend these apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App.

Apps can be either personal, enabling one-on-one communication, or shared, where multiple users can collaborate.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are essential for organizations. Apps facilitate concise communication, integration with necessary services, and on-the-go accessibility, making them a preferred choice for organizations.

### Uses of Apps in Organizations:

- **Connect with Customers:** Apps help to maintain connections with customers, provide services, and share information.

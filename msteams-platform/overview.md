# Teams App Overview

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can also extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, enhancing the collaborative experience for users.

- **Personal vs. Shared Apps**:
  - **Personal App**: Enables one-on-one communication.
  - **Shared App**: Allows multiple users to share app space for collaboration.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are crucial for organizational success. Apps facilitate:
- Concise communication.
- Integration with necessary services.
- Accessibility on-the-go.

Organizations use apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information—creating a cohesive environment for business needs. Below are several areas where apps play a vital role:

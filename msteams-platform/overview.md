# Teams Apps That Fit

Microsoft Teams offers a flexible suite of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or a combination of these capabilities and can also extend their functionality to Outlook and Microsoft 365. Teams apps enhance the collaborative experience within Teams.

- **Personal Apps**: Allow one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps**: Enable multiple users to collaborate in a shared space.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are key for any organization. Apps offer:

- **Concise Communication**: Effective tools for sharing information.
- **Integration**: Seamless connectivity with necessary services.
- **Accessibility**: Tools accessible on-the-go.

Organizations rely on apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information. Apps facilitate collaborative work environments that serve both external and internal business needs.

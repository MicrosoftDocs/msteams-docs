# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, or any combination of the capabilities. You can extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. These apps expand the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users.

- **Personal Apps:** Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps:** Allow multiple users to share app space to collaborate.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are key for an organization. Having concise communication, integration with necessary services, and on-the-go accessibility are reasons organizations are increasingly choosing to rely on apps.

Apps connect organizations with their customers, provide services, and share information. They are meeting places for people to work together, helping to build a cohesive environment for external and internal business needs.

## Build Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps make your collaborative workspace more productive by bringing key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people gather, learn, and work. Apps extend the capabilities of the Teams platform to fit your requirements. Create something new or integrate an existing app to utilize the benefits for your business needs.

### Key Benefits of Using Teams

- **Communication and Collaboration:**
  Successful Teams apps pull information from another system, facilitate conversation, and enable user actionsâ€”all within the Teams client. Push information to targeted audiences based on events or actions in external systems.

- **Social Interactions:**
  Teams is a social platform. Use custom social-focused apps to extend your company culture into collaboration spaces. Apps can be used for polls, feedback sharing, enabling connection, and communication.

- **Common Business Processes:**
  Effective Teams apps handle repetitive tasks like sales call reports, project tracking, resource reservation, help desk requests, and expense reporting.

- **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots:**
  One-to-one conversational bots offer open-ended features where the conversation is just between the bot and user. Simplify complex information with dialogs (task modules). 

  For instance, a design tool app with notifications for multiple collaborators enhances engagement. Also, chat bots can replace emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments.

- **Surface Existing App:**
  Enable existing web apps, SharePoint sites, PowerApps, or web-based applications in Teams. Port functionalities to Teams to grow user base and engagement.

- **Teams Store Advantage:**
  Enhance app availability on Teams Store and leverage it as a marketing opportunity. Ideal for start-ups to increase product awareness. The Teams Store marketplace helps audiences discover your app.

- **Build Once, Run Everywhere:**
  Extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365 for cross-platform delivery: design tailored experiences from a single codebase for Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app environments. Users remain within work context using your app, and administrators benefit from consolidated management.

  Utilize the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions to enable personal tabs and message extension apps for Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365. Reach users across platforms with the same codebase, broadening the app's reach while streamlining development and distribution processes.

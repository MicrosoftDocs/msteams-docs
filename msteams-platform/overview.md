# Fitting Teams app

Microsoft Teams offers a variety of apps provided by Microsoft and third-party services. Teams apps can include tabs, bots, message extensions, and any combination of these capabilities. Teams apps can also be extended to work with Outlook and Microsoft 365 App. These apps enhance the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users.

Apps may be personal or shared. Personal apps facilitate a one-on-one communication, while shared apps enable multiple users to collaborate within the same app space.

## Achieving organizational objectives

Collaboration and communication are critical for an organization's success. Apps that provide concise communication, integrate with essential services, and offer mobile accessibility are becoming increasingly favored by organizations.

Organizations utilize these apps for customer engagement, service provision, and information sharing. But there's more! Apps are also a workspace for people to collaborate. A well-designed app aids in creating a unified environment for meeting external and internal business needs.

Take a look at some sectors where an app can aid in meeting business requirements.

| **Development possibilities** | **Business opportunities** |
| --- | --- |
| - Desktop app <br> - Web app <br> - Mobile app | - Enhance user engagements <br> - Promote your app on the Microsoft Teams Store |
| **Customer benefits** | **Internal workflows** |
| - Mobile accessibility <br> - Customer data security <br> - Simplified communication | - Automation of repetitive tasks <br> - Task simplification with bots, such as Q&A and helpdesk |

With the Teams platform, you can create an app by extending its capabilities to suit your needs. You can either create something new for Teams or integrate an existing app.

Consider these example developer personas and app scenarios:

Teams apps can fulfill all these scenarios and enhance collaboration within your Teams across Microsoft 365.

## Create applications with the Microsoft Teams platform

Teams apps enhance your collaborative workspace's productivity by bringing critical information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people congregate, learn, and work. Apps allow you to extend the capacities of the Teams platform to meet your requirements. Whether you create something entirely new or integrate an existing app, you employ the benefits of the Teams platform for your specific business needs.

The advantages of creating apps range from fulfilling organizational goals to improving internal productivity.

Here's why Teams is the best choice for your app requirements:

* **Communication and collaboration**

    Most successful Teams apps pull information from another system, facilitate a conversation about it, and allow users to take action. Teams makes all these tasks possible directly within the Teams client. Information can even be pushed to a specific audience based on an event or action in an external system.

* **Social interactions**

    Teams is a social platform; custom social-focused apps encourage your team to incorporate your company culture into your collaboration space. Use apps for creating polls, sharing feedback, fostering connections, and promoting communication.

* **Common business processes**

    Repetitive tasks, such as creating and sharing a sales call report, tracking a project timeline, reserving common resources, submitting help desk requests, and creating expense reports make for effective Teams apps.

    :::image type="content" border="false" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/scenario-approval-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot presents a Teams app for internal use.":::

* **Personal apps with tabs and bots**

    One-on-one conversational bots are some of the more unrestricted features in Teams. The conversation occurs only between the bot and the user. You have the flexibility to include dialogs (known as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) to simplify complex information sets.

    For instance, if your app is a design tool with multiple collaborators, a shared bot that notifies all users fosters user engagement.

    Additionally, a chatbot can easily replace emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments.

* **Surface existing app**

    If you have an existing web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or another web-based application, it might make sense to enable some or all of it in Teams. Extending existing apps and porting interactive features to Teams promotes user base growth and user engagement for your app.

* **Advantages of Teams Store**

    Promote your app on the Teams Store to boost its availability and use it as a marketing opportunity. If you are a startup, the Teams platform can enhance awareness of your products. The Teams Store marketplace can be an excellent platform for large audiences to discover your app.

* **Build once, deploy everywhere**

    Broaden your Teams app across Microsoft 365, offering a streamlined method to deliver cross-platform apps to an expanded user base. From a single codebase, you can create tailored app experiences for Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app environments. Users can use your app without leaving their work context, and administrators benefit from a unified management and deployment workflow.

    Use the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions to enable your personal tab and message extension apps to run on other Microsoft 365 experiences in addition to Teams. You can reach users on platforms such as Outlook and Microsoft 365 app with the same codebase, extending the reach of your app and simplifying your development and distribution processes.

# Customizing Teams app

Microsoft Teams offers a suite of apps provided by either Microsoft or third-party services. Teams apps can be designed as tabs, bots, or message extensions, or a combination of these. You can even extend Teams apps to function on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App, capitalizing on their value for user collaboration.

These apps can be categorized as personal or shared. Personal apps enable direct one-to-one communication, while shared apps allow multiple users to collaborate within the same app space.

## Prioritizing organizational objectives

Organizations heavily rely on effective collaboration and communication, a quality that apps greatly enhance. Apps facilitate concise communication, integrate with necessary services, and provide on-the-go accessibility, making them a frequent choice for modern organizations.

Apps are not only a medium for organizations to engage with their customers, deliver services, and disseminate information, but are also used as collaborative workspaces. A well-positioned app helps to engender a cohesive environment that caters to both external and internal business needs.

Let's delve into some areas where an app can cater to a business need.

You can customize apps on the Teams platform according to your needs. There is an option to either create a brand new app for Teams or integrate an existing one.

Below are some examples of developer personas and app scenarios:

Through Teams apps, all these scenarios can be realized and collaboration within your Teams across Microsoft 365 can be enhanced.

## Creating apps with Microsoft Teams platform

Teams apps augment your collaboration workspace productivity, bringing key information, commonly used tools, and trusted methodologies to areas where individuals often congregate, learn, and work. Apps allow you to expand the functionality of the Teams platform to satisfy your particular criteria. You have the option to either create something brand new or integrate an existing app, and utilize the benefits of the Teams platform for your unique business needs.

The benefits of creating apps range from achieving organizational goals to enhancing internal productivity.

Here are several reasons why Teams is your best choice for app needs:

* **Communication and collaboration**

    Successful Teams apps often involve extracting information from another system, facilitating a conversation about it, and enabling users to take action. Teams allows you to carry out these tasks directly within the Teams client. You can also push information to a targeted audience based on events or actions in an external system.

* **Social interactions**

    Teams is a social platform. Custom apps that are socially focused encourage the extension of your company culture into your collaborative space. Use these apps for conducting polls, enabling feedback exchanges, fostering connections, and facilitating communication.

* **Common business operations**

    Tasks like creating and sharing a sales call report, tracking project timelines, reserving resources, submitting help desk requests, and expense reports are repetitive tasks and can be effectively integrated into Teams apps.

* **Personal apps featuring tabs and bots**

    One-to-one conversational bots are extremely flexible features in Teams that facilitate private conversations between bots and users. These bots can simplify complex sets of information through dialogues (referred to as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x).

    For instance, if your app is a design tool that involves multiple collaborators, a shared bot that sends notifications to all users will boost user engagement.

    Additionally, a chatbot can easily replace emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments.

* **Expanding existing apps**

    If you already have a web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based applications, integrating them into Teams can be beneficial. Porting existing apps and their interactive functionalities to Teams can aid growth in user base and user engagement for your app.

* **Leverage of Teams Store**

    By promoting your app on the Teams Store, you can increase its accessibility and use this as a marketing opportunity. If you operate a startup, the Teams platform can raise awareness about your products. The Teams Store marketplace can effectively expose your app to a large audience.

* **Develop once, run everywhere**

    By extending your Teams app across Microsoft 365, you can deliver cross-platform apps to an expanded user base from a single codebase. This allows you to create an experience tailored to Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app environments. Users won't have to leave their work environment to use your app, and administrators will enjoy simplified management and deployment workflows.

    Use the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions to empower your personal tab and message extension apps to work in other Microsoft 365 experiences in addition to Teams. This way, you can reach users on various platforms like Outlook and Microsoft 365 app, all using the same codebase. This will increase the reach of your app and streamline your development and distribution processes.

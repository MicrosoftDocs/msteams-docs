# Understanding Microsoft Teams Apps

Microsoft Teams provides a range of applications, either developed by Microsoft or by third-party services. These apps can take the form of tabs, bots, or message extensions, or may involve a combination of these capabilities. Furthermore, these apps can be extended to work with Outlook and Microsoft 365. They come in two types: personal and shared. Personal apps facilitate one-on-one communication while shared apps allow multiple users to collaborate in a shared app space. 

## How Teams Apps Drive Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are at the heart of any successful organization. Owing to their ability to facilitate concise communication, seamlessly integrate necessary services, and offer on-the-go accessibility, apps are rapidly becoming a key component of many companies. 

Teams apps are used by organizations to engage with their customers, deliver services, and disseminate information. More importantly, these apps serve as a nexus for collaborative work. A well-designed app can aid in creating a unified environment that caters to both internal and external business needs.

Teams apps can also stimulate user engagement, improve app visibility on the Microsoft Teams Store, enhance data security, facilitate communication, and much more.

## Building Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Apps developed with the Teams Platform can significantly boost your workspace's productivity by bringing together crucial information, widely used tools, and trusted workflows. Through this platform, you can either create an entirely new app or integrate an existing one to meet your specific business needs.

Teams apps are ideal for your app requirements as they offer numerous advantages, including simplified communication and collaboration, custom social interactions, automation of common business processes, personalization with tabs and bots, enhancing existing apps, and the potential to reach a wider audience on the Teams Store. 

These apps can also be extended across Microsoft 365, providing a streamlined approach to distributing cross-platform apps from a single codebase. This ensures end users don't have to switch out of their workflow to use your app, and administrators gain from a consolidated management and deployment workflow.

# Teams Apps That Fit  

Microsoft Teams offers a variety of apps provided by Microsoft and external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. They enhance the Teams collaborative experience for users and can be extended to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps.

- **Personal Apps:** Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps:** Allow multiple users to collaborate in a shared space.

## Driving Organizational Goals  

Collaboration and communication are crucial for any organization. Apps facilitate:

- Concise communication
- Integration with necessary services
- On-the-go accessibility

Apps serve as a hub for teamwork and can create a cohesive environment, both externally and internally.

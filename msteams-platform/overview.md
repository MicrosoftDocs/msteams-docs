# Customized Teams Apps

Microsoft Teams offers a variety of apps from Microsoft and other external services. Teams apps can exist in the form of tabs, bots, or message extensions, with the capability of being any combination of these. You can expand the functionality of Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App as well. Such apps increase the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users.

Apps have the ability to be personal or communal. A personal app facilitates one-on-one communication, while a communal app enables multiple users to share app space for collaborative purposes.

## Aiding Organizational Objectives

For any organization, collaboration and communication are fundamental. Businesses are increasingly choosing to rely on apps due to their ability to facilitate crisp communication, integrate required services, and provide mobile accessibility.

Organizations use apps to engage with their customers, provide services, and disseminate information. But there's more to apps than that. They also serve as a common platform for collaboration. A strategically positioned app can help create a cohesive environment for meeting both external and internal business needs.

Let's delve into some areas where an app can be instrumental in meeting a business objective.

You can customize apps on the Teams platform by adjusting app functionalities to suit your needs. You can either build something new or integrate an existing app.

Check out these examples of developer personas and app scenarios:

You can meet all of these scenarios with Teams apps and boost collaboration within your Teams across Microsoft 365.

## Construct Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps aid your collaborative workspace to increase productivity by bringing valuable information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people habitually congregate, learn and work. You can extend the functionalities of the Team platform with apps to suit your requirements. Whether you create something entirely new or integrate an existing app, you can use the advantages of the Teams platform for your specific business needs.

The benefits of building apps range from meeting organizational goals to enhancing internal productivity.

Here's why Teams is the ideal fit for your app requirements:

* **Communication and Collaboration**

    The most successful Teams apps involve extracting information from another system, discussing it, and allowing users to react. Teams enables you to complete all of these tasks directly within the Teams client. You can even disseminate information to a targeted audience based on an event or action in an external system.

* **Social Interactions**

    Teams is a social platform; custom social-focused apps inculcate your team to extend your company culture into your collaboration space. You can use apps to distribute polls, enable individuals to provide feedback to each other, and facilitate connection and communication.

* **Common Business Processes**

    Tasks such as creating and sharing a sales call report, tracking a project timeline, booking common resources, submitting help desk requests, and preparing expense reports are repetitive. Implementing these as Teams apps can be highly effective.

* **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots**

    Individual conversational bots are one of the most adaptable aspects of Teams. The conversation only involves the bot and your user. You have the flexibility to include dialogs (referred to as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) to simplify complex information sets.

    For example, if your app is a design tool with multiple collaborators, a shared bot that notifies all users helps increase user engagement.

    Moreover, a chatbot can easily replace emails and phone calls for IT or HR queries.

* **Integrate Existing App**

    If you already have a web app, a SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), a PowerApp, or any other web-based application, it could be beneficial to integrate some or all of it into Teams. Adding existing applications and importing interactive functions into Teams aids in expanding your user base and driving user engagement for your app.

* **Advantage of Teams Store**

    Publishing your app on Teams Store can increase the app's accessibility and present a marketing opportunity. If you're operating a startup, the Teams platform can help boost the visibility of your products. The Teams Store marketplace can be an excellent platform for large audiences to discover your app.

* **Develop Once, Run Anywhere**

    Broaden your Teams app across Microsoft 365, which delivers a streamlined method to provide cross-platform apps to an expanded user audience. From a single code base, you can create app experiences tailored for Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app environments. Users don't have to divert from their workspace to use your app, and administrators benefit from a consolidated management and deployment workflow.

    Utilize the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions to enable your personal tab and message extension apps to run in other Microsoft 365 experiences in addition to Teams. You can reach users on platforms such as Outlook and Microsoft 365 app all with the same codebase, widening the reach of your app and streamlining your development and distribution processes.

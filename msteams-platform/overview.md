# Microsoft Teams Developer Platform Overview

The Microsoft Teams platform empowers developers to create intelligent and collaborative experiences directly within the Teams environment. Developers can build agents and apps to achieve organizational goals, boost productivity, and foster collaboration. Additionally, the Teams platform enables seamless integration across Microsoft 365 platforms.

## What is the Teams Platform?

Teams is evolving from a communication hub into a collaborative and intelligent platform where people, data, and AI converge. You can build agents in Teams using the Teams SDK, which enables natural, conversational, and context-aware experiences powered by large language models (LLMs). Developers can continue to create Teams apps and extend Teams capabilities for task-specific workflows, data visualization, and integration with enterprise systems.

Consider these example developer personas and agent or app scenarios:

These scenarios can be addressed to enhance collaboration using Teams agents or apps.

## Why Build on the Teams Platform?

Whether you aim to build powerful agents or rich apps, the platform provides the tools to extend Teams with seamless, secure, and contextual solutions. With over 320 million monthly active users, the Teams platform enables custom experiences, workflows, and integrations where people work. You can facilitate communication and integrate agents and apps seamlessly across Microsoft 365 platforms.

Agents serve as digital workers within the organization. By building and integrating agents into Teams workspaces, organizations can connect with customers, deliver services, and share information efficiently. Key roles of an agent in Teams include:

- **Collaboration and Communication**: Agents facilitate concise, targeted interactions, integrating with essential services and providing on-the-go accessibility.
- **Business Enablement**: Agents streamline internal workflows and simplify processes such as Q&A, helpdesk, and approvals.
- **Secure Interaction**: Agents ensure secure data handling, ease of communication, and personalized experiences.

Agents in Teams can be deployed across desktop, web, and mobile platforms, and integrated into Teams to:

- Increase user engagement
- Surface key information and tools
- Automate processes

### Extend and Scale Agents

Agents can consolidate existing web apps, SharePoint sites, PowerApps, and other solutions into Teams, expanding reach and engagement. Publishing agents to the Teams Store increases visibility and adoption.

You can build a unified experience for agents. Develop agents once and deploy them across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 using a single codebase. This approach streamlines development, management, and user access, ensuring consistent experiences and efficient administration.

### Social Interactions and Personal Apps

Teams acts as a social platform where custom apps help extend company culture. Personal apps use conversational bots for direct user interaction, and task modules (dialogs) make complex data easy to manage.

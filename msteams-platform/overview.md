## Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. These apps expand the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users and can also be extended to work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App.  

Apps can be personal or shared:  
- **Personal App:** Enables one-on-one communication.  
- **Shared App:** Allows multiple users to share app space for collaboration.  

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are key for organizations. Here's why organizations are increasingly relying on apps:  
- **Concise Communication:** Integrate with necessary services.  
- **On-the-Go Accessibility:** Enhance business operations anytime, anywhere.  

Organizations use apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information, acting as a meeting place for collaboration.

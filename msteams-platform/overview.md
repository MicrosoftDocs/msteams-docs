# Creating a Fitting App for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams offers various apps built by Microsoft or external services to enhance team collaboration. These apps, which can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, can broaden Teams' functionality to other applications such as Outlook and Microsoft 365. Personal apps support one-on-one communication, while shared apps allow collaboration among multiple users.

## The Role of Apps in Organizations 

Apps serve as essential tools for streamlined communication, service integration, and mobile accessibility in organizations. They facilitate customer connection, service provision, and information sharing. Furthermore, apps establish a cohesive environment for both internal and external business needs by acting as a central hub for collaboration. 

Incorporating an app into your business can support organizational objectives in various ways, as outlined in the table below:

| **Development Options** | **Business Opportunities** |

Microsoft Teams allows you to either develop a customized apps or integrate existing apps to meet your business needs.

## Developing Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Creating apps with Microsoft Teams can enhance collaborations, increase productivity, and streamline various business processes. The reasons for integrating Teams into your app development include:

- **Communication and collaboration:** Teams allows information extraction from external systems, discussions about it, and acts directly within the Teams client. You can also push information to specific audiences based on external system events or actions.

- **Social Interactions:** Teams provides a platform for creating custom social-focused apps that can improve company culture. These apps can facilitate polls, feedback sharing, and communication.

- **Common business processes:** Teams can automate repetitive tasks like sales report creation and sharing, project timeline tracking, resource booking, help desk requests, and expense reports.

- **Personal apps with tabs and bots:** Teams offers one-on-one conversational bots that facilitate dialogs between bots and users. For example, a shared bot can notify all users of a design tool app when there are updates, thereby increasing user engagement.

- **Integration of existing apps:** Existing web apps, SharePoint sites, PowerApps, or other web-based applications can be integrated into Teams to improve user base and user engagement.

- **Teams Store advantage:** Listing your app on the Teams Store can increase its accessibility, provide a marketing opportunity, and enhance product awareness for startups.

- **Cross-platform functionality:** Using the same codebase, you can extend your Microsoft Teams app to Microsoft 365, Teams, Outlook, and other Microsoft 365 environments. This feature benefits end-users by maintaining their work context and administrators by streamlining the management and deployment workflow.

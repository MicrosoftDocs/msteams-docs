# Teams App that Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can also extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App, expanding the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users. Apps can be personal or shared, where a personal app enables one-on-one communication, and a shared app lets multiple users collaborate.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are crucial for organizations. Concise communication, integration with necessary services, and on-the-go accessibility are reasons why organizations increasingly rely on apps. Apps are used to connect with customers, provide services, and share information, fostering a cohesive environment for business needs.

Key areas where apps help meet business needs include:

## Build Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps enhance your collaborative workspace by bringing key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people gather, learn, and work. Here's why Teams is best suited for your app needs:

- **Communication and Collaboration**  
  Teams apps pull information from other systems, facilitate conversations about it, and let users take actionâ€”all directly within the Teams client.

- **Social Interactions**  
  Custom social-focused apps on Teams encourage company culture in collaboration spaces, enabling actions like sending polls, sharing feedback, and more.

  :::image type="content" border="false" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/overview/scenario-social.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams app for building team culture.":::

- **Common Business Processes**  
  Repetitive tasks like sales call reporting, project timeline tracking, reserving common resources, and more make effective Teams apps.

- **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots**  
  One-to-one conversational bots provide flexible dialogs (task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) to simplify complex information, enhance engagements, and replace conventional communication channels like emails and calls.

- **Surface Existing Apps**  
  Enable existing web apps, SharePoint sites, and PowerApps in Teams to grow your app's user base and engagement.

- **Teams Store Advantage**  
  Use the Teams Store to improve your app's availability and marketing. The store serves as a platform for large audiences to discover your app.

- **Build Once, Run Everywhere**  
  Extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365, reaching users on other platforms like Outlook with the same codebase, enabling streamlined development and distribution.

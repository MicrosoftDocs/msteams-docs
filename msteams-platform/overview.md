# Teams Apps That Fit

Microsoft Teams offers a variety of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. Furthermore, you can extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps, enhancing the collaborative experience for users. Apps can be personal or shared:  
- **Personal apps** enable one-on-one communication.  
- **Shared apps** allow multiple users to communicate and collaborate.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are essential for any organization. Hereâ€™s why organizations increasingly choose to rely on apps:

- **Concise Communication:** Integrate necessary services seamlessly.
- **On-the-Go Accessibility:** Access important information anytime, anywhere.
  
Organizations utilize apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information. A well-placed app helps build a cohesive environment for addressing both external and internal business needs.

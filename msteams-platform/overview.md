## Building Teams Apps

Teams apps have the potential to increase workspace productivity by providing important information, common tools, and standardized processes. By either creating a new app or integrating an existing one within the Teams platform, your business needs can be specifically catered to.

Teams apps are widely chosen due to the numerous perks they offer, such as aiding organizational objectives and boosting internal efficiency.

Teams is a highly recommended platform for your business for several reasons:

* **Communication and Collaboration**

    The main functions of a robust Teams app include collating information from various sources, facilitating communication about this information, and allowing for user interaction. All these actions can be performed directly within the Teams client, and information can be pushed to a specific audience based on external factors.

* **Social Interactions**

    Teams also functions as a social platform. Tailor-made apps focused on fostering social interactions extend your company culture into your collaborative space. This feature is ideal for sending polls, sharing feedback, enabling communication, and connections.

* **Personalized Interaction with Tabs and Bots**

    Personal conversational bots offer a broad range of features on Teams. These bots allow for direct interaction between the user and the bot. You can simplify complex tasks by integrating dialogs, also known as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x.

* **Repurpose Existing Apps**

    If you already have a web-based app—be it a web app, SharePoint site, PowerApp, or any other—you can enable it on Teams.

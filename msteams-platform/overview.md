## Building Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps can significantly enhance productivity within a collaborative workspace by integrating key information, tools, and processes. Building such apps provides several benefits, including the opportunity to achieve organizational goals and boost internal productivity.

### Why Choose Teams for Your App Needs?

1. **Communication and Collaboration**
   - Teams apps facilitate the flow of information, conversations, and actions directly within Teams, even allowing information to be pushed to targeted audiences based on specific events or actions.

2. **Social Interactions**
   - As a social platform, Teams supports custom apps that foster company culture within the collaboration space, with features for polls, feedback sharing, and enhanced team connection.

# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of capabilities, extending the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users. Teams apps can also work on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. 

Apps can be:

- **Personal**: Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared**: Let multiple users share the app space to collaborate.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are key for organizations. Apps support these activities through:

- Concise communication
- Integration with necessary services
- On-the-go accessibility

Organizations use apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information. A well-placed app builds a cohesive environment for internal and external business needs.

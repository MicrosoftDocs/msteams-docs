# Teams app that fits

Microsoft Teams is a collaborative platform that prvoides a workspace for organizations to collaborate through apps for communication, meetings, and file sharing. Teams offers proprietary Microsoft and third-party apps. Teams apps can be message extensions, tabs, bots, or any combination of the capabilities.

Apps can be personal or shared. A personal app enables one-on-one communication and a shared app lets multiple users share app space to collaborate.  You can extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 to enhance their collaborative experience.

## Drive organizational goals

Organizations use apps as a collaborative platform to connect with their customers, provide services, and exchange information. A well-placed app helps build a cohesive environment for external and internal business needs.

You can build apps with Teams platform to increase user engagement, automate repetitive tasks, or simplify repetitive tasks with bots. You can create something brand new for Teams or integrate an existing app. Take a look at these example developer personas and app scenarios:

## Why build apps with Teams

Teams apps help your workspace become more productive by bringing key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people gather to learn, and work.

Here's why Teams is best suited for your app needs:

* **Cross-platform collaboration**

    Teams apps allow taking information from other systems, having a conversation about it, and letting users take action within the Teams client. You can even push information to a targeted audience based on an event or action in an external system.

* **Social interactions**

    Teams is a social platform that encourages extending your company culture into your collaboration space. Use apps to send polls, share feedback, and enable connection and communication.

* **Common business processes**

    Manage repetitive tasks like creating and sharing a sales call report, tracking your project timeline, reserving common resources, submitting help desk requests and expense reports effectively with Teams apps.

* **Enhance apps with bots**

    Teams bots can enhance your app's functionalities. Dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) simplify complex information to the user. If your app has multiple collaborators, a shared bot notifies all users at once. Additionally, a chat bot is an easy replacement for emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments.

* **Surface existing app**

    If you've got an existing web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based application, you can extend it to Teams and port its interactive functionalities to grow user base and engagement.

* **Teams Store advantage**

    Publish your app on Teams Store to improve app's availability and discoverability. If you're running a startup, Teams platform helps to increase product awareness.

* **Build once, run everywhere**

    Create cross-platform app experiences tailored for Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app environments from a single codebase. Users don't have to leave the context of their work to use your app and administrators benefit from a consolidated management and deployment workflow.

# Teams Apps That Fit

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps from Microsoft or external services. These apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App as well, enhancing the Teams collaborative experience for users.

- **Personal Apps:** Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps:** Allow multiple users to collaborate within a shared space.

A well-designed app helps build a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs.

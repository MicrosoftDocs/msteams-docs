# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These can be tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can also extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App, enhancing the collaborative experience for users.

- **Personal Apps**: Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps**: Allow multiple users to collaborate within an app space.

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are critical for organizational success. Many organizations rely on apps for:

- Concise communication.
- Integration with necessary services.
- On-the-go accessibility.

Apps help organizations connect with customers, provide services, and share information, creating a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs. Here are some ways apps help meet business needs:

Meet all these scenarios with Teams apps to enhance collaboration within your Teams and across Microsoft 365.

## Build Apps with the Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps enrich collaborative workspaces by integrating key information, tools, and processes where people gather, learn, and work. Apps extend the capabilities of the Teams platform to meet your specific business needs, offering organizational efficiencies and increased productivity.

Why Microsoft Teams is ideal for your app needs:

1. **Communication and Collaboration**  
   Most successful Teams apps involve integrating external system information, engaging in conversation about it, and facilitating user actionsâ€”all within Teams.

2. **Social Interactions**  
   Use Teams as a social platform to extend company culture. Implement custom apps for sending polls, sharing feedback, and fostering communication.

4. **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots**  
   Develop one-to-one conversational bots for flexible, confidential communication. Use shared bots for collaborative engagement.

   Extend existing web apps, SharePoint sites, or PowerApps to Teams, enhancing user engagement and app visibility.

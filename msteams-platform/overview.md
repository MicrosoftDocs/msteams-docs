# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. These apps can include tabs, bots, message extensions, or any combination of capabilities. They can extend to Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps, enhancing the Teams collaborative experience for users.

Organizations leverage apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information, fostering a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs.

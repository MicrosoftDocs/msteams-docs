# Teams app that fits

Microsoft Teams provides a collection of apps offered by Microsoft and external services. Teams apps appear as tabs, bots, or message extensions, or they combine multiple capabilities. You extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 App as well. These apps expand the Teams collaborative experience for users by bringing functionality and convenience into one integrated platform.

Apps come as personal or shared experiences. A personal app enables one-on-one communication, while a shared app lets multiple users collaborate within the same workspace.

## Driving organizational goals

Collaboration and communication form the foundation for every organization. Concise communication, integration with essential services, and on-the-go accessibility motivate organizations to rely on apps for improved productivity and customer engagement.

Organizations use Teams apps to connect with customers, provide services, and share information. Apps also serve as meeting places where people collaborate. A well-crafted app builds a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs. Each business area enjoys a tailored solution, as illustrated in this table:

| **Development options** | **Business opportunities** |
| --- | --- |
| - Desktop app <br> - Web app <br> - Mobile app | - Increase user engagements <br> - Make your app discoverable on Microsoft Teams Store |
| **Customer benefits** | **Internal workflows** |
| - On-the-go accessibility <br> - Secure customer data <br> - Ease of communication | - Automate repetitive tasks <br> - Simplify tasks with bots, such as Q&A and helpdesk |

You build apps with the Teams platform by extending app capabilities to meet your specific needs. You create something brand new for Teams or integrate an existing app seamlessly.

Consider these example developer personas and app scenarios:

Teams apps support all these scenarios and enhance collaboration within your Teams environment across Microsoft 365.

## Build apps with Microsoft Teams platform

Teams apps increase productivity in your collaborative workspace by bringing key information, common tools, and trusted processes into the space where people work and learn. Teams apps extend the capabilities of the Teams platform to meet your requirements. You create something brand new or integrate an existing app while utilizing the benefits specific to Teams for your business needs.

The benefits of building apps span from meeting organizational goals to enhancing internal productivity. Each benefit contributes to creating a comprehensive solution that satisfies both external and internal stakeholders:

* **Communication and collaboration**

    Successful Teams apps pull information from external systems, spark relevant conversations, and let users take meaningful actionsâ€”all directly within the Teams client. You push information to a targeted audience, reacting to events or actions in external systems efficiently.

* **Social interactions**

    Teams functions as a social platform. Custom apps that focus on social interactions encourage team members to infuse company culture into their collaboration space. You send polls, enable users to share feedback, and support connection and communication through these apps.

* **Common business processes**

    Repetitive tasks, such as creating a sales call report, tracking project timelines, reserving shared resources, submitting help desk requests, or expense reporting, benefit from automation through Teams apps. These applications simplify workflows and reduce manual work.

* **Personal apps with tabs and bots**

    One-to-one conversational bots offer open-ended features within Teams. You create bots that engage in direct conversation with users. Including dialogs, or task modules as referred to in TeamsJS v1.x, simplifies complex sets of information. For example, a design tool with multiple collaborators benefits when a shared bot notifies all participants, enhancing user engagement. A chat bot also replaces emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments effectively.

* **Surface existing app**

    When you manage an existing web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based application, you enable a portion or the entirety of it in Teams. Extending existing apps and porting interactive functionalities into Teams grows the user base and increases engagement.

* **Teams Store advantage**

    You promote your app on the Teams Store to improve its availability while creating a marketing opportunity. Startups benefit from increased product awareness. The Teams Store marketplace offers a platform where large audiences discover apps, expanding your app's reach.

* **Build once, run everywhere**

    You extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365 and deliver cross-platform apps from a single codebase. This approach tailors app experiences for Teams, Outlook, and the Microsoft 365 app environment simultaneously. End users remain in their work context, while administrators enjoy consolidated management and deployment workflows.

    You use the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions to enable personal tab and message extension apps in other Microsoft 365 experiences along with Teams. You reach users on platforms such as Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app with one codebase, broadening your app's audience and streamlining both development and distribution.

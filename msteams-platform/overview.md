# Understanding Microsoft Teams Apps 

Microsoft Teams provides a collection of apps developed by Microsoft and third-party services. Teams apps can come in various layouts, including tabs, bots, or message extensions. Part of their versatility is that they can also extend to Microsoft 365 App and Outlook. Utilizing these apps can greatly enhance the value of teams' collaborative experience.

The ability of apps to allow users to work together makes them essential tools in creating a unified environment tailored to meet both external and internal business requirements.

# Teams App That Fits

Microsoft Teams offers a collection of apps provided by Microsoft or external services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions, or any combination of these capabilities. You can also extend Teams apps to work on Outlook and Microsoft 365 Apps. These apps enhance the Teams collaborative experience for users.

- **Personal Apps**: Enable one-on-one communication.
- **Shared Apps**: Allow multiple users to share app space for collaboration. 

## Driving Organizational Goals

Collaboration and communication are essential for any organization. Effective communication, integration with necessary services, and on-the-go accessibility are reasons why organizations increasingly rely on apps. Apps serve as meeting places for people to work together, helping build a cohesive environment for both external and internal business needs.

# Customized Teams Apps

Microsoft Teams provides a variety of apps developed by Microsoft or third-party services. Teams apps can be tabs, bots, or message extensions or any blend of these capabilities. You can modify Teams apps to function on Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. These apps enhance the value of the Teams collaborative experience for users.

Apps can either be personal or shared. A personal app encourages one-on-one interaction and a shared app enables numerous users to collaborate within the app space.

## Achieving Business Goals

Effective collaboration and communication are vital for an organization's success. Concise communication, integration with necessary services, and mobile accessibility are the reasons why organizations are increasingly relying on apps.

Organizations utilize apps for customer interaction, delivering services, and disseminating information. But there's more! Apps serve as the meetup spot for individuals to collaborate. A strategically placed app fosters a cohesive environment for catering external and internal business requirements.

Let's delve into the ways an app can fulfill business needs.

With the Teams platform, you can create apps by extending app capabilities to meet your specific needs. Develop something innovative for Teams or integrate an existing app.

Check out these example developer personas and app scenarios:

With Teams apps, you can meet all these scenarios and enhance collaboration across your Teams within Microsoft 365.

## Develop Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps aid your collaborative workspace in being more productive by integrating crucial information, common tools, and trusted processes with people's workspace. Apps serve as the means to extend the capabilities of the Teams platform to suit your needs. You can either make something new or incorporate an existing app, and leverage the benefits of the Teams platform for your unique business needs.

Benefits of developing apps range from achieving business goals to enhancing internal efficiency.

Here are the reasons that make Teams apt for your app needs:

* **Communication and collaboration**

   Most successful Teams apps involve fetching information from another system, discussing it, and enabling users to take action. Teams allow you to perform all these tasks directly within the Teams client. You can even push information to a specific audience upon an event trigger or action in an external system.

* **Social interactions**

   Teams is a social platform; tailor-made social-focused apps provoke your team to incorporate your company culture into your collaboration space. Use apps for conducting polls, allowing individuals to exchange feedback, fostering connection, and facilitating communication.

* **Common business processes**

   Mundane tasks like creating and sharing a sales call report, tracking your project timeline, reserving shared resources, submitting help desk requests, and expense reports could be accomplished effectively using Teams apps.

* **Personalized apps with tabs and bots**

   Personalized conversational bots in Teams provide endless possibilities. The conversation only involves the bot and your user. You can simplify complex sets of information using dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x).

   For instance, in a design tool where collaboration is needed, a shared bot that notifies all users can boost user engagement.

   Also, a chatbot can efficiently replace emails and phone calls to IT or HR departments.

* **Integrate existing app**

   If you already have an existing web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based application, it may be worthwhile to incorporate some or all of it into Teams. Extending existing apps and porting interactive functionalities into Teams can augment your user base and engagement.

* **Teams Store benefit**

   Improve your app's accessibility by launching your app on the Teams Store and utilize this as a marketing opportunity. If you're running a startup, Teams platform can raise awareness about your products. The Teams Store marketplace can serve as an excellent platform for larger audiences to discover your app.

* **One-time build, wide implementation**

   Distribute your Teams app across Microsoft 365 and provide a streamlined way to deliver cross-platform apps to a wider audience: from a single codebase, you can create app experiences catered to Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app environments. Instead of leaving their workspace to use your app, users can operate within their work context, and administrators can avail unified management and deployment workflows.

   With the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions, your personal tab and message extension apps can function in other Microsoft 365 experiences besides Teams. By maintaining the same codebase, you can broaden the reach of your app and streamline your development and distribution processes, reaching users on platforms such as Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app.

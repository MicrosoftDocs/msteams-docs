# An Introduction to Teams Apps

Microsoft Teams provides a suite of apps, from Microsoft and other services. Possibilities include tabs, bots, message extensions, or interactions using multiple features. You can expand the capacity of Teams apps to include Outlook and Microsoft 365 App. These extensions enrich the collaborative experience of Teams for users.

Private and shared apps offer different functions. A private app allows for one-on-one communication, while a shared app creates a space for multiple users to collaborate.

## Enhancing Collaborative Goals

Strong communication and collaboration are essential to any organization. The promise of concise communication, integrated essential services, and mobile availability motivate a growing number of organizations to rely on apps. 

Organizations use apps to reach their customers, deliver services, and disseminate information. But the utility doesn't stop there! Apps also provide a space for collective work. The strategic integration of an app can develop a cohesive environment for addressing business needs, internally and externally.

Refer to the image and table below for an understanding of how apps can meet business needs:

With Teams apps, you can enhance collaboration within your Teams across Microsoft 365.

## Creating Apps with Microsoft Teams Platform

Teams apps can enhance productivity by integrating critical information, shared tools, and established processes where people congregate, learn, and work. Apps allow you to extend the capabilities of the Teams platform to suit your needs. Create a completely new app or integrate an existing one â€” either way, you leverage the benefits of the Teams platform for your specific business requirements.

Here's why Teams makes the ideal platform for your app needs:

* **Communication and Collaboration**

Teams apps are most successful when they extract information from a system, allow for discussion about it, and enable users to act. Teams allows these actions to take place within the Teams client. You can even disperse information to a select audience based on events or actions in an external system.

* **Social Interactions**

Teams functions as a social platform; custom social-focused apps can help extend your company culture into your collaboration space. Apps can facilitate polls, provide a platform for feedback, and enhance communication.

* **Routine Business Processes**

Repetitive tasks like creating a sales call report, tracking your project timeline, reserving resources, submitting helpdesk requests, or filing expense reports can be streamlined with Teams apps.

* **Personal Apps with Tabs and Bots**

Bots allow for flexible one-to-one conversions. For example, a design tool may have a shared bot that informs all users, increasing user engagement. A chat bot can effortlessly replace emails and phone calls for IT or HR departments.

* **Incorporate Existing Apps**

If you have an existing web app, SharePoint site (or SPFx extension), PowerApp, or other web-based applications, consider incorporating some or all of it into Teams. By bringing existing apps and interactive functionalities into Teams, you can expand your user base and increase user engagement.

* **Advantages of the Teams Store**

Promoting your app on the Teams Store can increase its availability and serve as a marketing opportunity. For startup companies, the Teams platform can raise product awareness. The Teams Store marketplace can bring your app to a larger audience.

* **Develop Once, Employ Everywhere**

Extend your Teams app across Microsoft 365 for a unified approach to cross-platform app delivery. You can reach users on platforms including Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app, broadening the reach of your app and streamlining your development and distribution processes.

Ensure to use the latest app manifest and Teams JavaScript client library versions to run your personal tab and message extension apps in other Microsoft 365 experiences in addition to Teams.

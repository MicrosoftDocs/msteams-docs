# The Teams solution

Microsoft Teams Platform is a powerful, flexible platform for creating apps for Teams. It provides a vast suite of development environments and tools to support app development.

## The user story

In this scenario, you will map user needs to Teams functionalities. Consider the case of a developer from a Tours and Travel agency who wants to create an app specifically tailored for travelers. The app must perform the following actions:

- Check the weather forecast and send it to travelers registered with the travel agency.
- Notify users one day before their departure date so they can plan accordingly.

The table below demonstrates how to collate and map the requirements to Teams functionalities:

| User app needs       | Check forecast | Notification before travel | Registered user |
| -------------------- | :----------: | :------------------------: | --------------- |
| **Capability**       | Notification bot | &nbsp;               | &nbsp;          |
| **Integration**      | &nbsp;         | &nbsp;               | :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph, Weather API |
| **Scope**            | &nbsp;         | Personal app         | &nbsp;          |
| **Integration point**| &nbsp;         | Notification         | &nbsp;          |

Based on these requirements, the recommended Teams app solution is:

Teams app solution: A Teams *notification bot* app that checks and *sends forecast notification* to *registered users* before their travel date.

This image illustrates a sample solution that integrates a bot for sending weather forecast notifications, demonstrating a practical example of how Teams functionalities can be applied to meet user needs.

To develop this app, follow these sequential steps:

1. Create a notification bot app.
   - This involves setting up a bot that can send messages within Teams.
2. Integrate with an external weather forecast API to connect and request forecast data for a specific date and location.
   - This API integration ensures that the app receives accurate and timely weather information.
3. Integrate with :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph for registered users.
   - Using Microsoft Graph helps manage user data seamlessly, ensuring that notifications are sent only to registered users.
4. Check and send forecast details based on the user's travel date and travel location.
   - Implement logic to verify the travel dates and locations to trigger timely notifications.

## Dive deeper

Enhance your app by customizing functionalities such as user authentication, and take advantage of tools like Microsoft Graph and the Developer Portal for advanced features.

For further guidance, refer to the Teams Developer Documentation which provides comprehensive instructions based on your app requirements. The table below outlines which documentation resource best fits your needs:

Practical Example:  
Imagine you are building a travel planner app for a travel agency. By following these steps, you can create a bot that collects weather data from an external API and sends notifications to travelers via Microsoft Teams. This helps ensure that travelers have the necessary forecast information to plan their trips effectively.

# The Teams Solution

The Microsoft Teams Platform is a powerful and flexible environment for building apps within Teams. It provides a comprehensive suite of development environments and tools to support rapid app development and integration.

## The User Story

Having reviewed the Teams offerings, you can now map these capabilities to real user needs. Consider the following scenario:

A developer from a Tours and Travel agency wants to build an app for their travelers. This app must:

- Check and deliver weather forecasts to registered travelers.
- Notify users one day prior to their departure date so they can plan accordingly.

The following table collates and maps the required user functionalities to corresponding Teams capabilities:

| User App Needs               | Check Forecast         | Notification Before Travel       | Registered User                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | :--------------------: | :------------------------------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capability**               | Notification Bot       | &nbsp;                          | &nbsp;                                                                                 |
| **Integration**              | &nbsp;                 | &nbsp;                          | :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph, Weather API |
| **Scope**                    | &nbsp;                 | Personal App                    | &nbsp;                                                                                 |
| **Integration Point**        | &nbsp;                 | Notification                    | &nbsp;                                                                                 |

**Teams App Solution**: Develop a Teams *notification bot* app that checks the weather forecast and *sends forecast notifications* to *registered users* prior to their travel dates.

Teams provides a rich set of capabilities to help you deliver a feature-rich app experience. To develop this app, follow these steps:

1. Create a notification bot app.
2. Integrate with an external weather forecast API. This step allows the app to connect and request forecasts for specific dates and locations.
3. Integrate with :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph for managing registered users and accessing related data.
4. Use the integrated components to check and send forecast details based on the user's travel date and location.

*Real-World Example*: In a travel agency management system, this app can reduce last-minute travel issues by alerting travelers well in advance, ensuring they plan their trips based on accurate weather data.

## Dive Deeper

To further customize your app, consider integrating additional functionalities such as user authentication and enhanced data handling tools, like Microsoft Graph and the Teams Developer Portal.

Refer to the Teams Developer Documentation for more detailed guidance based on your requirements for building a Teams app. Choose the appropriate documentation based on your current experience level:

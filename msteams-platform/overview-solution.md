# The Teams Solution

Microsoft Teams Platform is a powerful, flexible platform for creating apps for Teams. It provides a vast suite of development environments and tools to support app development.

## The User Story

You've had a view of Teams offerings. Now, you can map them to user needs. Letâ€™s revisit the scenario:

A developer from a tours and travel agency wants to build an app for their users, the travelers. The app must:

- Check and send the forecast to travelers registered with the travel agency.
- Notify the users a day before the departure date for better planning.

### Requirements Mapping

Collate and map requirements to Teams functionalities:

| User App Needs           | Check Forecast     | Notification Before Travel | Registered User |
|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Capability**           | Notification Bot   | &nbsp;                     | &nbsp;          |
| **Integration**          | &nbsp;             | &nbsp;                     | :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph, Weather API |
| **Scope**                | &nbsp;             | Personal App               | &nbsp;          |
| **Integration Point**    | &nbsp;             | Notification               | &nbsp;          |

### Steps to Develop the App

1. Create a notification bot app.
2. Integrate with an external weather forecast API to connect and request forecasts for specific dates and locations.
3. Integrate with :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph for registered users.
4. Check and send forecast details based on users' travel dates and travel locations.

### Real-World Scenario

Using this Teams app, a travel agency can automatically inform travelers about weather conditions at their destination, facilitating better trip planning and enhancing customer satisfaction.

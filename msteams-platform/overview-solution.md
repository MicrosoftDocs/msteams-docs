# The Teams solution

Microsoft Teams Platform is a powerful, flexible platform for creating apps for Teams. It provides a vast suite of development environments and tools to support app development.

## The user story

You've had a view of Teams offerings. You can now map them to user needs. Letâ€™s revisit the scenario.

The developer from Tours and Travel agency wants to build an app for their users, the travelers. The app must:

- Check and send the forecast to travelers registered with the travel agency.
- Notify the users a day before the departure date so they can plan.

Collate and map requirements to Teams functionalities:

| User app needs | Check forecast | Notification before travel | Registered user |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Capability** | Notification bot | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| **Integration** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph, Weather API |
| **Scope** | &nbsp; | Personal app | &nbsp; |
| **Integration point** | &nbsp; | Notification | &nbsp; |

**Teams app solution**: A Teams *notification bot* app that checks and *sends forecast notification* to *registered users* before their travel date.

Teams offers these and many more capabilities to bring your users a feature-rich app solution. To develop this app:

1. Create a notification bot app.
1. Integrate with an external weather forecast API to connect and request forecast for specific date and location.
1. Integrate with :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph for registered users.
1. Check and send forecast details based on user's travel date and travel location.

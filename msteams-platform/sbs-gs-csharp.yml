    Here's a list of tools you'll need to install for building and deploying a Teams app.

    | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> Install one of the following two workloads:<br> • **ASP.NET and web development** <br> • | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the workloads. |
    | &nbsp; | [Teams Toolkit](#install-teams-toolkit) | A Visual Studio extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use latest version. |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, call - all in one place. |

    ## Install Teams Toolkit

    Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to create a project scaffolding for your app. It creates the necessary directory structure for all selected capabilities with the required files in place, ready to build the project.

    Teams Toolkit is available as an extension in Visual Studio.

    You can download the latest Visual Studio installer from the [Visual Studio download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You'll need to first install the Visual Studio installer before installing Visual Studio.

    After you open the Visual Studio installer, in the pop-up workloads window.

      1. Select the box **ASP.NET and web development** workload.
      1. Select the box **Microsoft Teams development tools** in the installation details panel.
      1. Select **Install**.

          :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-overview/visual-studio-install_1.png" alt-text="Visual studio-installation":::

      1. Select **Launch** to open Visual Studio.

          :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/visual-studio-launch1.png" alt-text="Launch visual studio":::
          
         > [!IMPORTANT]
         > You're recommended to download Visual Studio 2022 17.3.0 version, since Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio is GA in this version. This article is written for Visual Studio 2022 17.3.0 version. Teams Toolkit version 17.3.* or higher.

      1. Select **Extensions** > **Manage Extensions**.

          :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/select-extension.png" alt-text="Select Extensions.":::

         The following Manage Extension window appears:

          :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/manage-extension.png" alt-text="Manage Extensions.":::

      1. Select **Installed** and you can see **Teams Toolkit** extension installed.
    
          :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/select-ttk.png" alt-text="Select Teams Toolkit":::

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Check for sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you will not be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.
    
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Example of what you see after signing up for the Microsoft 365 developer program.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. Create a free account before you begin.

    Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to do first

   Start Microsoft Teams app development by creating your first app. This app uses the tab capability.
    
    If the prerequisites are in place, let's begin!

    The following steps help you to create project workspace for your tab app in Visual Studio

    1. Open Visual Studio.

       The following page appears:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/visual-studio.png" alt-text="Open Visual Studio":::

    1. Select **Create a new project**.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/select-create-project.png" alt-text="Select create project":::

    1. Enter **Teams** in the search box.
    1. Select **Microsoft Teams App** and select **Next**.
    
        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/enter-teams.png" alt-text="Enter Teams":::

       Configure your new project page appears.

    1. Enter the following details to configure your new project.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/enter-project-name.png" alt-text="Enter Project name":::

        1. Enter required project name in **Project name**.
        1. Select required location to save project files and folders.
        1. Select **Create**.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/select-tab.png" alt-text="Select tab":::

       Now Teams tab app is created in a few seconds.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/tap-app-in-vs.png" alt-text="Project Creation":::     

    ## Take a tour of tab app source code
      
    Teams Toolkit provides all components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files under **Solution Explorer**.  

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/solution explorer.png" alt-text="Solution Explorer"::: 

    Although you're free to choose any UI framework (or not to use any), this sample template code provides a scaffolding with React components.

    Among other items in this directory structure, the Toolkit maintains:

    | Folder name | Contents |
    | --- | --- |
    | `.fx/configs` | Configuration files that user can customize for the Teams app. |
    | - `.fx/configs/config.<envName>.json` | Configuration file for every environment. |
    | - `.fx/configs/azure.parameters.<envName>.json` | Parameters file for Azure BICEP provision for every environment. |
    | - `.fx/configs/projectSettings.json` | Global project settings that apply to all environments. |
    | - `.fx/states` | Provision output that is generated by Teams Toolkit.  The toolkit creates this folder after you provision resources for your app. |
    | - `.fx/states/state.<envName>.json` | Provision output file for every environment. |
    | - `.fx/states/<env>.userdata` | Sensitive user data for the provision output for every environment. |
    | `templates/appPackage` | App manifest template files, and the app icons: color.png and outline.png. |
    | - `templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json` | App manifest for running the app in local or remote environment.  |
    | `templates/azure` | BICEP template files |

    Here's a list of tools you'll need to install for building and deploying a Teams app.

    | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.com/download)<br> Install one of the following two workloads:<br> • **ASP.NET and web development** <br> • **.NET Core cross-platform development** | .NET. You can install the free community edition of Visual Studio 2019, and install the workloads also. |
    | &nbsp; | [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Git to use the Sample C# app repo from GitHub. |
    | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bot and message extension) require inbound connections. You need to expose your development system to Teams through a tunnel. A tunnel is not required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
    | &nbsp; | [Teams Toolkit](#install-teams-toolkit) | A Visual Studio 2019 extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use latest version. |
    | &nbsp; | [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) | Web-based portal to configure, manage, and distribute your Teams app including to your organization or the Teams store. |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, call - all in one place. |
    | **Optional** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Azure Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) and [Microsoft Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) | Azure tools to access stored data or to deploy a cloud-based backend for your Teams app in Azure. |
    

    ## Verify git installation

    If Visual Studio installation prompts you to add `git` to the path, select it. 
   
    To verify the version of git installed:

    1. Open a terminal window. 
    2. Run the following command to verify the `git` version installed on your machine:

        ```bash
        $ git --version
        ```

        Output example: `git version 2.17.1.windows.2`

    ## Install Teams Toolkit

    Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to create a project scaffolding for your app. It creates the necessary directory structure for all selected capabilities with the required files in place, ready to build the project.

    Teams Toolkit is available as a Visual Studio 2019 extension.

    The Teams Apps will be available as a template in Visual Studio 2019.

    You also can find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msft-vsteamstoolkit.vsteamstoolkit).

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Check for sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you will not be able to preview and test your app in Teams locally.
    
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot is an example that shows what you see after signing up for the Microsoft 365 developer program.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

    Now you've got all tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use a suitable terminal window on your platform. These examples use Git Bash but can be run on most platforms.

    Open the latest version of Visual Studio and install any updates.

    You can use the same terminal window to run the commands in this tutorial.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/vs-project-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Properties window.":::

    1. Move through the screen to view the **Web Server Settings**.

    1. Make the following settings in **Debug** pane:
        - Set **App URL** to `http://localhost:3333/`.
        - Clear **Enable SSL**.

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/vs-project-web-server-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Web server settings for C# project properties.":::

    1. Select **Build Solution** from the **Build** menu.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/app-build-complete.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the completed build.":::

    1. Select the **F5** key, or select **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu to run the sample.

        When the app starts, a browser window opens. It shows the root of your app. You can go to the following URLs to verify that all the app URLs are loading:

        - `https://localhost:3333/`

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/local-host-after-debug.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the local host.":::

        - `https://localhost:3333/hello`

        - `https://localhost:3333/second`

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/local-host-second-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows second tab of the app.":::

        > [!Note]
        > If you receive an error `Could not find a part of the path … bin\roslyn\csc.exe`, update the package with the command `Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r`.

    ## Deploy your sample app locally

    Microsoft Teams apps are web applications that provide one or more capabilities. Make your app available on the internet so that the Teams platform can load it. Host your app using `ngrok` to create a tunnel to the local process on your computer.

    After you host your app, make a note of its root URL, such as `https://yourteamsapp.ngrok.io` or `https://yourteamsapp.azurewebsites.net`.

    ### Tunnel using ngrok

    After you install ngrok, you can create a tunnel to deploy your app locally:

    1. Open a new terminal window.
    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3333.

        ```bash
        ngrok http 3333 -host-header=localhost:3333
        ````
        The ngrok tunnel is created. Here's an example:

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/csharp-ngrok-tunnel.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows ngrok tunnel.":::

        You can try adding `hello`, `first`, or `second` to the ngrok tunnel url to view different tab pages of the app.
        
        Ngrok listens to requests from the internet and routes them to your app running on port 3333.

    To verify the app's local deployment:

    1. Open the browser.
    1. Load your app using the following URL:

        `https://<forwarding address in ngrok console session>/`

        Here's an example of the URL:

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/csharp-ngrok-verify-tunnel.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows C# app running locally on ngrok tunnel.":::

    1. Make a note of the forwarding address in ngrok console. You need this URL to deploy your app in Teams.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you've used a different port during [build](#build-your-first-app), ensure you use the same port number to setup the `ngrok` tunnel.
        > [!TIP]
        > It's a good idea to run `ngrok` in a different terminal window. It helps to keep `ngrok` from interfering with the app, when you'll need to stop, rebuild, and rerun the app. The `ngrok` session provides useful debugging information in this window.
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > If you use the free version of ngrok, your app will be available only during the current session on your development machine. It isn't available if the machine is shut down or goes to sleep. When you restart the service, it returns a new address. Then, you must update every location that uses the outdated address. Remember this step when sharing the app for testing.

- title: Configure your first C# app using Developer Portal
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You can use [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) to upload the app package to Teams and configure app capabilities. Developer Portal is a Teams app that simplifies the creation and registration of an app. Install from the Teams store!
    
    After you build and test your Teams app, you can configure and preview it using Developer Portal.
    
    In this page, you'll learn to [configure the app package in Developer Portal](#configure-the-app-package-in-developer-portal).

    <details>
    <summary>Publish option in Visual Studio 2019</summary>

    This tutorial uses Developer Portal to configure app capabilities and publish your app. 
    
    However, Visual Studio 2019 has built-in support for app deployment to different providers, including Azure:

    :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/publish-to-azure.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Publish to Azure menu item in Visual Studio 2019.":::

    Microsoft Azure hosts your .NET application on a free tier. It uses shared infrastructure that is sufficient to run the `Hello World` sample. For more information, see [creating a new free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

    If you use this option, you can enter the details of the Azure site and Azure resources and publish your app. 
    
    For this tutorial, you do not need to use this step.

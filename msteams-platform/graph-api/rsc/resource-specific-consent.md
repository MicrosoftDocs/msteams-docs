# Resource-specific consent for your Teams app

Resource-specific consent (RSC) is an authorization framework built by Microsoft Teams and Microsoft identity platform that allows for granting scoped access to an app.

Through RSC, an authorized user can give an app access to the data of a specific instance of a resource type. They don't need to give app access to every instance of the resource type in the entire tenant.

For example, a person who owns both team A and team B can decide to give Contoso app access to the data of only team A and not team B. The same concept of scoped data access applies to chats and meetings as well.

Following are the types of RSC permissions:

1. The resource type on which data access is being granted:
    * Teams (and the channels within those teams)
    * Chats (and meetings associated with those chats)
    * Users

1. The mode of data access:
    * Application: The app accesses data without the presence of a signed-in user.
    * Delegated: The app only accesses data in the context of a signed-in user's sessions. It doesn't allow access in the absence of a signed-in user.

| **Resource type** |  &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| Team | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Chat or meeting | ✔️ | ✔️ |

* [Supported RSC permissions](#supported-rsc-permissions)
* [Grant RSC permissions to an app](grant-resource-specific-consent.md)

## Types of RSC permissions

Use RSC permissions to determine the data access methods for your app. A user's ability to grant RSC permissions varies based on resource types and access modes. The following are the types of RSC permissions for an app based on access mode:

* **Application context RSC permissions (application permission)**: Allows an app to access data without the user being signed in. Only resource owners can grant application RSC permissions.

* **Delegated context RSC permissions (delegated permission)**: Allows an app to access data only on behalf of a signed-in user. No access is allowed in the absence of a signed-in user. Only authorized users can install an app in a specific scope. They can also grant any delegated RSC permissions that the app requests in that specific scope at app installation. For example, if regular members have the permission to install an app inside a team, then they can also grant delegated RSC permission to the app in that specific team.

### Basic RSC Permissions

A limited set of RSC permissions have been reviewed by Microsoft privacy and security teams and have been deemed low risk. These permissions can be consented to at all times by any user when they install and use an app. The following low-risk basic permissions will always be consented to upon installation.

| Permission name | Action | Type: Delegated | Type: Application |
| ----- | ----- | :-----: | :-----: |
|`TeamsActivity.Send.Group`|Send activity feed notifications to users in this team. | NA | Supported |
|`TeamsActivity.Send.User`|Send activity feed notifications to the user. | NA | Supported |

### RSC-based data access APIs

Microsoft Graph SDK, Microsoft Bot Framework SDK, and Microsoft TeamsJS client library support fine-grained data access through RSC. The supported modes and resource types vary across the API surfaces.

| RSC mode | Supported SDKs | App manifest version | Resource types | RSC-related controls for the entire tenant | Who can consent to RSC permissions? |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Application| • Microsoft Graph  <br> • Microsoft Bot Framework | >=v1.6 | Teams, chats, and meetings | • Microsoft Graph-based controls for chats and meetings <br> • Microsoft Entra admin center-based controls for Teams |• Team: A team owner or member <br> • Chat: A chat member <br> • Meeting: A meeting organizer or presenter |
| Delegated | Microsoft Teams Client | >=v1.12 | Teams, chats, meetings, and users | Always on | Any user authorized to install an app in the specific scope. |

> [!NOTE]
> The `TeamsActivity.Send` RSC application permission is always enabled at the tenant level. App users don't need admin consent to use the permission.

## Supported RSC permissions

The following list provides all the RSC permissions categorized based on resource type. Each table also states which data access modes are available for each permission.

* [RSC permissions for a team](#rsc-permissions-for-a-team): Includes the channels within a team.
* [RSC permissions for a chat or meeting](#rsc-permissions-for-a-chat-or-meeting): Includes the meetings associated with the chats.
* [RSC permissions for user access](#rsc-permissions-for-user-access): Includes permission for users to access different resources.

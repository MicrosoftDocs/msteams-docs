# Get meeting transcripts and recordings using Graph APIs

You can now configure your app to fetch Microsoft Teams meeting transcripts and recordings in the post-meeting scenario. Your app can use Microsoft Graph REST APIs to access and fetch transcripts and recordings generated for a Teams meeting that has been scheduled beforehand.

Here are some use cases for fetching meeting transcripts and recordings using Graph API:

| Use case | How Transcript and Recording APIs help... |
| --- | --- |
| You need to obtain transcripts and recordings for capturing meaningful insights from multiple meetings across the Sales vertical. It's time-consuming and inefficient to keep track of all meetings, and to retrieve meeting transcripts and recordings manually. After the meeting is over, you'd need to examine conversations in all those meetings to obtain useful information. | Using Graph APIs in your app to fetch meeting transcripts and recordings automatically retrieves them from all meetings relevant for your purpose. Your app can receive meeting notifications, and get the transcript and recording when it's generated after the meeting ends. This data can then be used to gain: <br> • Aggregated insights and intelligence analysis <br> • New leads and highlights <br> • Meeting follow-ups and summaries |
| As an HR initiative, you're holding a brainstorming session to understand and improve employee health and productivity. Having to continually take notes to provide post-meeting summary can impede the flow of thoughts, and you might not capture all valuable suggestions. After the session, you'd need to analyze the discussion to gather data points for planning improvements. | Using Graph APIs in your app to fetch transcripts and recordings post-meeting frees you and the participants to fully focus on the discussion. The content of the meeting transcript and recording is available for: <br> • Engagement and sentiment analysis <br> • Listing tasks or issues <br> • Follow-up meetings and notifications |

You can fetch meeting transcript, recording, or both using Graph APIs.

> [!NOTE]
> The APIs to fetch meeting transcript and recording content are metered APIs. For more information, see [payment models for meeting APIs](/graph/teams-licenses#payment-models-for-meeting-apis).

To fetch the transcript and recording for a particular meeting:

- [Configure permissions on Microsoft Entra ID to access transcript and recording](#configure-permissions-on-azure-ad-to-access-transcript-and-recording)
- [Obtain meeting ID and organizer ID](fetch-id.md)
- [Get notified when the meeting transcripts and recordings are available](/graph/teams-changenotifications-callrecording-and-calltranscript)
- [Use Graph APIs to fetch transcript](/graph/api/resources/calltranscript?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true)
- [Use Graph APIs to fetch recording](/graph/api/resources/callrecording?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true)

## Configure permissions on Microsoft Entra ID to access transcript and recording

Your app must have the required permissions for fetching transcripts and recordings. It can access and fetch transcripts and recordings for a Teams meeting using organization-wide application permissions or resource-specific consent (RSC) application permissions for a particular meeting.

### Use organization-wide application permissions

You can configure your app to access meeting transcripts and recordings across the tenant. In this case, the meeting organizer doesn't need to install your app in the Teams meeting chat. When the tenant administrator authorizes the organization-wide application permissions, your app can read and access transcripts and recordings for all meetings in the tenant.

For more information about the organization-wide application permissions that can be granted to your app, see [online meeting permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#online-meetings-permissions).

### Use meeting-specific RSC application permissions

If you want your app to fetch transcripts and recordings only for the Teams meeting where it's installed, configure  meeting-specific RSC permission for your app. Authorized users can install your app in the meeting chat. After the meeting ends, your app can make the API call to obtain the transcript and recording for that meeting.

For more information about the meeting-specific RSC permissions, see [RSC permissions for a chat or meeting](../rsc/resource-specific-consent.md#rsc-permissions-for-a-chat-or-meeting).

After you've configured the permissions, configure your app to receive [change notifications](/graph/teams-changenotifications-callrecording-and-calltranscript) for transcripts and recordings available events or all relevant meeting events. Notifications contain meeting ID and organizer ID that help in accessing transcript content and recording. Your app can fetch the transcript and recording for a meeting when it's generated after it ends. The content of the transcript is available as `.vtt` file. The recording of the meeting is available as an `.mp4` file.

For more information about how your app can know when the meetings ends, see [subscribe to change notifications](fetch-id.md#subscribe-to-change-notifications) and [use Bot Framework to get meeting ID and organizer ID](fetch-id.md#use-bot-framework-to-get-meeting-id-and-organizer-id).

For more information about how your app can know when a transcript or recording is available after the online meeting ends, see [get notified when transcripts and recordings are available](/graph/teams-changenotifications-callrecording-and-calltranscript).

> [!NOTE]
> The process for calling Graph APIs to access and retrieve transcripts and recordings remains the same for both meeting-specific RSC application permissions and organization-wide application permissions. These APIs support only scheduled meetings.

# Use Microsoft Graph to Import Messages from External Platforms to Teams

You can use Microsoft Graph to migrate users' existing message history and data from an external system into a Teams channel. This feature enables users to continue conversations without interruption, by recreating the messaging hierarchy from a third-party platform directly within Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, Microsoft might require you or your customers to pay extra fees based on the amount of data imported.

## API Migration Workflow

Use the step-by-step migration flow to ensure a seamless transition of historical messages in both existing and newly created channels or chats by enabling migration mode.

## Step-by-Step Migration Flow

### Step 1: Create or select a channel/chat

You can either create a new channel or chat in a Team or use an existing channel or chat.

> [!NOTE]
> All APIs listed in the following sections require the `Teamswork.Migrate.All` permission in the application context. Delegated authentication isn't supported.

### Step 2: Use startMigration API to start channel migration

* You can use the startMigration API, which enables migration mode on existing Teams channels, allowing import of historical messages. Previously, import operations were restricted to newly created standard channels in an empty state. Refer [Import third-party platform messages to Teams using Microsoft Graph](import-external-messages-to-teams.md)

* You can define a minimum timestamp for messages to be migrated. The provided timestamp must be older than the channelâ€™s current createdDateTime and replaces it during migration. The supported channels are all the existing Shared, Private, and Public channels. You can optionally provide a request body to specify the minimum timestamp for the messages to be migrated.

#### Request

```http
POST  /teams/{team-id}/channels/{channel-id}/startMigration
{
   ACTUAL CODE
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> * You can optionally provide a request body to specify the minimum timestamp for the messages to be migrated.
> * If no request body is provided, the API uses the current date and time as the minimum timestamp.
> * `ConversationCreationDateTime` must be:
>   * Greater than the minimum value for `DateTimeOffset`.
>   * Less than the current value of the channel's `CreatedDateTime`.

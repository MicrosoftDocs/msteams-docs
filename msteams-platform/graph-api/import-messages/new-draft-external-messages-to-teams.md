## Import third-party platform messages to Teams using Microsoft Graph

With Microsoft Graph, you can migrate users' existing message history and data from an external system into a Teams channel. By enabling the recreation of a third-party platform messaging hierarchy inside Teams, users can continue their communications in a seamless manner and proceed without interruption.

> In the future, Microsoft may require you or your customers to pay additional fees based on the amount of data imported.

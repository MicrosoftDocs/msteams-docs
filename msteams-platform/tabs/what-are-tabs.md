In the document, I have provided a detailed guide for a Microsoft Teams HelloWorld sample app, covering key elements such as code setup, environment configuration, usage, and deployment in Azure. The guide is structured to facilitate understanding and implementing the sample app features within Microsoft Teams, Office, and Outlook. I included necessary prerequisites, detailed instructions for setting up the bot, using tunneling solutions like NGROK or Dev Tunnels, and uploading app manifests to Teams. Additional resources are also provided for further exploration.

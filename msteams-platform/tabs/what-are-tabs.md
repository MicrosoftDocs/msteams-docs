## Microsoft Teams Tabs

Tabs in Microsoft Teams are adaptable webpages embedded within different entities like Teams, Outlook, and Office 365. They function as HTML `<iframe/>` elements directed to domains specified in the app manifest.

### Types of Tabs

1. **Static Tabs**: 
   - Best for individual, unchanging content.
   - Pinned on the left navigation bar for quick access.
   - Extendable to group chats, channels, or meetings.

2. **Configurable Tabs**: 
   - Provide dynamic content delivery to channels and group chats.
   - Enable interaction with content tailored to the userâ€™s context.

### Usage Scenarios

#### Personal Tabs

- **Scenario**: Show personal dashboards or user-specific information directly within Teams.
- **Example**: A personal finance app tab that displays a user's spending habits.

#### Channel or Group Tabs

- **Scenario**: Collaborate on shared content, such as reports or specifications.
- **Example**: A project management tab showing team progress and tasks.

### Benefits

- **Pinnable and Instant Access**: Quickly pin or unpin for immediate usability.
- **Unified Functionality**: Operates smoothly across personal, group, and channel scopes.
- **Flexible Configuration**: URLs can be updated for dynamic content display within tabs.

### Declaring Custom Tabs

To set up a tab within your application, include it in your app's manifest by specifying:
- URL corresponding to the content.
- The scope indicating where the tab will appear (personal, channel, or group).

#### Example: Basic Configuration

- Static Tab: Set `contentUrl` in manifest under `staticTabs` to maintain the same content across all user instances.
- Configurable Tab: Utilize `configurationUrl` in manifest, allowing setup via parameters suited to different teams or chats.

### Developing Tabs

Use tools like the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio or CLI to streamline tab creation and integration. Ensure that configurations align with the intended UX by:
- Constructing static tabs for straightforward scenarios.
- Building configurable tabs for a more tailored experience.

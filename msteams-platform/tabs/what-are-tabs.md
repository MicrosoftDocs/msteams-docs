# Building Tabs for Microsoft Teams

## Introduction

Tabs in Microsoft Teams are client-aware webpages that can be embedded in Microsoft Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365. These are simple HTML `<iframe>` tags pointing to domains specified in the app manifest and can be added to channels, group chats, or personal apps.

> Tabs are also available in Government Community Cloud (GCC), GCC-High, and Department of Defense (DOD) environments.

## Types of Tabs

There are two primary types of tabs:
1. **Static Tabs**: Included by default and work across different scopes.
2. **Configurable Tabs**: Allow users to input configurations for use in multiple teams or chats.

## Scopes for Tabs in Teams

Tabs can exist within three different scopes:
- **Personal**: Individual user access and are pinned on the left navigation bar.
- **Group Chat/Channels**: Collaborative spaces linked to chats or channels.
- **Meetings**: Useful as pre-pinned apps for discussions or presentations.

### Benefits of Static Tabs

- **Pinnable and Instant**: No mandatory configuration dialog required, making them app-like.
- **Unified**: A single tab can function across multiple scopes.
- **Optional Configuration**: Modify the default URL after pinning in Teams.

### Use Cases and Scenarios

**Scenario 1 - Resource Integration**: Embed an existing corporate website as a static tab for easy access by employees.

**Scenario 2 - Support Content**: Use static tabs for "About" and "Help" pages within a Teams app, enhancing user navigation.

**Scenario 3 - Regular Interaction**: Create channel tabs that deep-link to specific items, promoting focused cooperation and dialogue.

## Creating Tabs

### Steps to Create a Custom Tab in Teams

1. **Declare in App Manifest**: Define the URL and scope for each tab.
   
2. **Embed Content**:
   - **For Static Tabs**: Set the content URL directly in the app manifest.
   - **For Configurable Tabs**: Use a configuration page to customize URLs with query string parameters.

3. **Visual and Control Features**:
   - Awareness of user identity, locale, and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.
   - Use bots for deep linking and modal dialog integration from within a tab.

### Tab Development Tools 

- **Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code**:
   - Provides streamlined development.
- **Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio**:
   - Facilitates tab creation with IDE extensions.

## Testing and Deploying Tabs

When you build a Teams app that includes a tab, itâ€™s crucial to test its functionality across various devices and ensure it adapts to context changes, such as switching themes or language settings.

For a detailed step-by-step guide on creating tabs, refer to the [create a content page](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/content-page.md) and [configuration page](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md) instructions.

## Conclusion

Microsoft Teams tabs can greatly enhance your collaborative workspace by integrating useful web content directly into Teams, personalizing user experience, and creating efficient collaborative environments.

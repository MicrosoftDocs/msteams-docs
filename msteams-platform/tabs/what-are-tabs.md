## Experience the App

Try the app in your Microsoft Teams client using the demo manifest deployed on Microsoft Azure. Upload the app package [.zip file](/samples/app-hello-world/csharp/demo-manifest/app-hello-world.zip) as a personal app or within your teams. Ensure [sideloading is enabled for your tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading).

## Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Teams**: Installed with an account (not a guest account).
- **NodeJS**: Version 16.14.2 or higher.
- **Dev Tunnel** or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): A tunnelling solution is required.
- **M365 Developer Account**: [Sign up for Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).
- **Teams Toolkit**: For VS Code [(Teams Toolkit for VS Code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) or [TeamsFX CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-cli?pivots=version-one).

## Run the App with Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

Simplify your experience by using the Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview).
2. Install [Teams Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).
3. Open this sample's directory using **File > Open Folder** in VS Code.
4. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account that has permissions to upload custom apps using the extension.
5. Select **Debug > Start Debugging** or press **F5** to launch the app in a browser for Teams integration.

## Use Cases and Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Deploying Thermolock for Secure File Sharing

Problem: A company wants to share sensitive documents across its multi-regional offices through Microsoft Teams while ensuring confidentiality and security. Solution: By integrating Thermolock, a Teams SSO-secured file-sharing application, employees can send encrypted documents through Teams chat directly. They will leverage the "Protect" button within the Teams app tab, encrypting files with AES-256 before sending, ensuring files remain confidential and allowing only authorized personnel to decrypt them. Thanks to Thermolock’s seamless Microsoft Graph API integration, files always stay within Microsoft’s compliance boundary during usage.

### Scenario 2: Collaborative Event Planning

Problem: A global marketing team needs to efficiently coordinate and plan a large international product launch event using Teams, keeping track of tasks and progress in real-time.
Solution: Integrate EventHub, a cloud-based event management tool, into Teams. By using EventHub’s API, every team can access a centralized Tab within their dedicated Teams Channel featuring a live taskboard and a Kanban-style view for task assignments. This enables asynchronous task management, allowing each member to visually track the event’s plan and execution stages. Simultaneously, deep linking allows people to quickly navigate to key workflows within EventHub’s web platform directly from chat commands in Teams.

# Create a personal tab with ASP.NET Core

In this quickstart we'll walk-through creating a custom personal tab with C# and ASP.Net Core Razor pages. We'll also use [App Studio for Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/build-and-test/app-studio-overview.md) to finalize your app manifest and deploy your tab to Teams.

[!INCLUDE [dotnet-core-prereq](~/includes/tabs/dotnet-core-prereq.md)]

## Get the source code

Open a command prompt and create a new directory for your tab project. We have provided a simple project to get you started. To retrieve the source code you can download the zip folder and extract the files or clone the sample repository into your new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-tabs.git
```

Once you have the source code, open Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution**. Navigate to the tab application directory and open **PersonalTab.sln**.

To build and run your application press **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu. In a browser navigate to the URLs below to verify the application loaded properly:

- `http://localhost:44325/`
- `http://localhost:44325/personal`
- `http://localhost:44325/privacy`
- `http://localhost:44325/tou`

## Review the source code

### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 2.2 Web Application empty template with the *Advanced - Configure for HTTPS* check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called *Index* as the default/home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** will be displayed as the home page for your application.

### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

- A **full color icon** measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
- A **transparent outline icon** measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
- A **manifest.json** file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files need to be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. Microsoft Teams will load the `contentUrl` specified in your manifest, embed it in an IFrame, and render it in your tab.

### .csproj

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the bottom of the file you'll see the code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

[!INCLUDE  [dotnet-update-personal-app](~/includes/tabs/dotnet-update-personal-app.md)]

[!INCLUDE [dotnet-ngrok-intro](~/includes/tabs/dotnet-ngrok-intro.md)]

- Open a command prompt in the root of your project directory and run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http https://localhost:44325 -host-header="localhost:44325"
```

- Ngrok will listen to requests from the internet and will route them to your application when it is running on port 44325.  It should resemble `https://y8rPrT2b.ngrok.io/` where *y8rPrT2b* is replaced by your ngrok alpha-numeric HTTPS URL.

- Be sure to keep the command prompt with ngrok running, and to make a note of the URL—you'll need it later.

- Verify that *ngrok* is running and working properly by opening your browser and going to your content page via the ngrok HTTPS URL that was provided in your command prompt window.

>[!TIP]
>You need to have both your application in Visual Studio and ngrok running to complete this quickstart. If you need to stop running your application in Visual Studio to work on it, **keep ngrok running**. It will continue to listen and will resume routing your application's request when it restarts in Visual Studio. If you have to restart the ngrok service it will return a new URL and you'll have to update every place that uses that URL.

### Run your application

- In Visual Studio press **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from your application's **Debug** menu.

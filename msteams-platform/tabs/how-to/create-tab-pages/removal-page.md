# Create a removal page

You can extend and enhance the user experience by supporting removal and modification options in your app. Teams enables users to rename or remove a channel or group tab and you can permit users to reconfigure your tab after installation. Additionally, the tab removal experience provides the users with post-removal options to delete or archive content.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]

## Enable your tab to be reconfigured after installation

Your `manifest.json` defines your tab's features and capabilities. The tab instance `canUpdateConfiguration` property takes a Boolean value that indicates whether a user can modify or reconfigure the tab after it's created. The following table provides the property details:

|Name| Type| Maximum size | Required | Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`canUpdateConfiguration`|Boolean|||A value indicating whether an instance of the tab's configuration can be updated by the user after creation. Default is `true`. |

When your tab is uploaded to a channel or group chat, Teams adds a right-click dropdown menu for your tab. The available options are determined by the `canUpdateConfiguration` setting. The following table provides the setting details:

| `canUpdateConfiguration`| true   | false | description |
| ----------------------- | :----: | ----- | ----------- |
|     Settings            |   √    |       |The `configurationUrl` page is reloaded in an iFrame allowing the user to reconfigure the tab. |
|     Rename              |   √    |   √   | The user can change the tab name as it appears in the tab bar.          |
|     Remove              |   √    |   √   |  If the  `removeURL` property and value are included in the **configuration page**, the **removal page** is loaded into an iFrame and presented to the user. If a removal page isn't included, the user is presented with a confirm dialog box.          |

## Create a tab removal page for your application

The optional removal page is an HTML page that you host and is displayed when the tab is removed. The removal page URL is designated by the `setConfig()` method (or `setSettings()` before TeamsJS v.2.0.0) within your configuration page. As with all pages in your app, the removal page must comply with [Teams tab prerequisites](../../../tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md).

### Register a remove handler

Optionally, within your removal page logic, you can invoke the `registerOnRemoveHandler((RemoveEvent) => {}` event handler when the user removes an existing tab configuration. The method takes in the [`RemoveEvent`](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages.config.removeevent?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) interface and executes the code in the handler when a user attempts to remove content. The method is used to perform cleanup operations such as removing the underlying resource powering the tab content. At a time only one, remove handler can be registered.

The `RemoveEvent` interface describes an object with two methods:

* The `notifySuccess()` function is required. It indicates that the removal of the underlying resource succeeded and its content can be removed.

* The `notifyFailure(string)` function is optional. It indicates that removal of the underlying resource failed and its content can't be removed. The optional string parameter specifies a reason for the failure. If provided, this string is displayed to the user; else a generic error is displayed.

#### Use the `getConfig()` function

You can use `getConfig()` (formerly `getSettings()`) to assign the tab content to be removed. The `getConfig()` function returns a promise that resolves with the Config object and provides the valid settings property values that can be retrieved.

#### Use the `getContext()` function

You can use `getContext()` to get the current context in which the frame is running. The `getContext()` function returns a promise that resolves with the Context object. The Context object provides valid `Context` property values that you can use in your removal page logic to determine the content to display in the removal page.

#### Include authentication

Authentication is required before allowing a user to delete the tab content. Context information can be used to help construct authentication requests and authorization page URLs. See [Microsoft Teams authentication flow for tabs](~/tabs/how-to/authentication/auth-flow-tab.md). Make sure that all domains used in your tab pages are listed in the `validDomains` array of your app manifest.

The following sample is an example of tab removal code block:

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

```html
<body>
  <button onclick="onClick()">Delete this tab and all underlying data?</button>
  <script>
    await microsoftTeams.app.initialize();
    pages.config.registerOnRemoveHandler((removeEvent) => {
      // Here you can designate the tab content to be removed and/or archived.
        const configPromise = pages.getConfig();
        configPromise.
            then((configuration) => {
                configuration.contentUrl = "...";
                removeEvent.notifySuccess()}).
            catch((error) => {removeEvent.notifyFailure("failure message")});
    });

    const onClick() => {
        pages.config.setValidityState(true);
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

```html
<body>
  <button onclick="onClick()">Delete this tab and all underlying data?</button>
  <script>
    microsoftTeams.initialize();
    microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnRemoveHandler((removeEvent) => {
      // Here you can designate the tab content to be removed and/or archived.
        microsoftTeams.settings.getSettings((settings) => {
        settings.contentUrl = "..."
        });
        removeEvent.notifySuccess();
    });

    const onClick() => {
        microsoftTeams.settings.setValidityState(true);
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

***

When a user selects **Remove** from the tab's dropdown menu, Teams loads the optional `removeUrl` page assigned in your **configuration page**, into an iFrame. The user is shown a button loaded with the `onClick()` function that calls `pages.config.setValidityState(true)` and enables the **Remove** button shown at the bottom of the removal page iFrame.

After the remove handler is executed, `removeEvent.notifySuccess()` or `removeEvent.notifyFailure()` notifies Teams of the content removal outcome.

>[!NOTE]
>
> * To ensure that an authorized user's control over a tab isn't inhibited, Teams removes the tab in both success and failure cases.
> * After you invoke the `registerOnRemoveHandler` event handler, respond to the method within 15 seconds. The app must call `setValidityState(true)` in order to enable the **Remove** button and for the remove handler to get invoked.
> * When the user selects **Remove**, Teams removes the tab after 30 seconds regardless of whether the actions have been completed or not.

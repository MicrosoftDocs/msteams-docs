# Create an offline tab

You can create a personal tab that works without an internet connection in Microsoft Teams. The tab stores the inputs given by the user locally. When the user's device reconnects to the internet, the tab automatically synchronizes the locally stored data with an Azure blob storage. This action ensures that all the offline changes made by the user are updated in the central storage, maintaining data consistency across the organization.

Creating a personal tab with offline functionality in Teams has the following advantages:

* **Accessibility**: You can access important information, documents, or tools without needing an internet connection, making it easier in remote areas or during travel.
* **Seamless Syncing**: Any changes made offline can automatically sync once youâ€™re back online. This ensures that your work is up-to-date without manual effort.

## Build an offline tab app

1. Download the [sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/tab-support-offline/nodejs/).

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

1. Go to **File** > **Open Folder...** and select the downloaded sample folder.

1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the activity bar.

1. Select **Sign in to Microsoft 365** using your credentials. Your default web browser opens to let you sign in.

:::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/ttk-sign-in-m365.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows where to sign in to Microsoft 365 and Azure.":::

1. Close the browser after signing in using your credentials.

1. Return to Teams Toolkit within Visual Studio Code.

The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar shows your Microsoft 365 account name. If custom app upload is enabled for your Microsoft 365 account, Teams Toolkit displays **Custom App Upload Enabled**.

1. Select the **F5** key to run your application in debug mode.

1. Teams opens in a browser window when the build is complete. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account, if prompted.

1. A dialog box opens to let you add the tab app to Teams. Select **Add**.

### Create and configure a Microsoft Entra app

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

1. Select **App Registrations** > **New registration** to create a new Microsoft Entra app:
   * **Name**: Set the name as your tab app's name.
   * **Supported account types**: Select an option of your choice as any account type works.
   * Leave the **Redirect URL** field blank.
   * Select **Register**.

1. When Azure registers the app, you're taken to the app's **Overview** page. Copy the **Application (client) ID**, **Object ID**, and **Directory (tenant) ID**; for later use.

1. [Generate the application ID Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)](authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-expose-an-api).

1. [Configure the API scope](authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-configure-api-scope).

1. [Configure the authorized client applications](authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-configure-authorized-client-application).

1. [Configure the API permissions](authentication/tab-sso-graph-api.md#to-configure-api-permissions) and add the following permissions:
   1. `User.Read` (enabled by default)
   2. `profile`
   3. `openid`
   4. `offline_access`
   5. `email`

1. [Create a client secret](../../toolkit/use-existing-aad-app.md#create-client-secret-for-microsoft-entra-app-optional).

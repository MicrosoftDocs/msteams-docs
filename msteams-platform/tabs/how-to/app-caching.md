# App caching for your tab app

App caching improves subsequent launch time of the apps within Teams by allowing you to keep some resources and assets in memory that you can use when rehydrating your app.

App caching is supported for the following:

| Scope | &nbsp; Desktop | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personal | ✔️ Cache lifetime: 30 minutes| ✔️ | ❌ |
| Chat | ✔️ Cache lifetime: 30 minutes| ✔️ | ❌ |
| Channel | ✔️ Cache lifetime: 30 minutes| ✔️ | ❌ |
| Meeting tab | ✔️ Cache lifetime: 30 minutes| ✔️ | ❌ |
| Meeting side panel or in-meeting apps | ✔️ Cache lifetime: 20 minutes| ❌ | ❌ |

## Enable app caching

To enable app caching, follow the steps:

1. Call `teamsCore.registerBeforeUnloadHandler` and `teamsCore.registerOnLoadHandler` APIs.

1. Use `contentUrl` and `entityId` passed into the load handler to route to the correct page within your app and invoke `notifySuccess` or `notifyFailure` to notify Teams client that the app initialization flow is complete.

   * [contentUrl](create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md#modify-or-remove-a-tab): Add content page URL.
   * [entityId](create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md#modify-or-remove-a-tab): Add a unique identifier.

1. Dispose resources and perform any cleanup needed in the `beforeUnload` handler, then invoke the `readyToUnload` callback to notify Teams client that the app unload flow is complete.

The following is the flow diagram of the first launch of an app that wants to opt into app caching (register the `load` or `beforeUnload` on the first launch of the app):

The following is the flow diagram of the launch of cached app:

When you opt into app caching, the iframe or webview that is used to host the embedded app is reused as users navigate to different instances of the app within a window. The iframe or webview used to host the app is hidden when the users leave the app and shown when the users return to the app.

> [!NOTE]
> If the app caching isn't enabled, the iframe or webview is recreated every time the user launches the app.

There are multiple reasons for an app to not get cached or for an app to get removed from the cache, some of the reasons are (numbers here are subject to change):

* If the system memory load is high, the app is removed from the cache.
* If the number of cached apps exceeds the maximum cache size, the oldest cached app is removed from the cache.
* The app isn't cached if Teams doesn't receive the `readyToUnload` signal from the app within 30 seconds after sending the `beforeUnload` notification.
* App caching is disabled if the system memory is less than 4 GB or if the available memory is less than 1 GB on Windows or 512 MB on Mac.
* Side panel is the only supported frameContext for app caching in meetings.
* App caching isn't supported for meetings where the invited user count is more than 20.
* If an app fails to load, the app isn't cached.
* On iOS, when the Teams app is terminated, the app is removed from the cache.

## Code example

The following code snippet is an example of `teamsCore.registerOnLoadHandler` and `teamsCore.registerBeforeUnloadHandler` APIs:

```javascript
microsoftTeams.teamsCore.registerOnLoadHandler((data) => {
    console.log("got load from TEAMS", data.contentUrl, data.entityId);
    // use contentUrl to route to correct page 
    // invoke notifySuccess when ready  
    app.notifySuccess();
});
microsoftTeams.teamsCore.registerBeforeUnloadHandler((readyToUnload) => {
    // dispose resources and then invoke readyToUnload
    readyToUnload();
    return true;
});
```

## Debug tool for cached apps

> [!NOTE]
> The debug tool for cached apps is available in [public developer preview](../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

You can enable Proto Task Manager in Teams, a debug tool that shows the status of your cached apps. In your Teams client, select the **Control+Shift+Alt+8** keys on Windows or **Command+Shift+Option+8** on Mac to open Proto Task Manager.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/app-cache-debug-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the caching tab in the Proto Task Manager in Teams." lightbox="../../assets/images/tabs/app-cache-debug-tool.png":::

The **AppCaching** tab contains the following details:

* **state**: Shows the app's cached or uncached state.
* **isActive**: Shows the active or inactive status of the cached app.
* **timeElapsed**: Shows the time elapsed since the app was cached.
* **supportsLoad**: Shows if the app has registered the `Load` handler if app caching is enabled.
* **supportsBeforeUnload**: Shows if the app has registered the `BeforeUnload` handler if app caching is enabled.
* **totalFrameMemory**: Shows the memory usage of the app.
* **totalFrameCommitMemory**: Shows the CPU usage of the app.

## Precaching tab apps

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Precaching tab apps is available in [public developer preview](../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).
> * Precaching tab apps is supported only in Teams web and desktop clients.

While caching reduces the subsequent load times of an app, precaching optimizes an app's initial load time by allowing Teams to preload the app. Teams preloads apps in the background after launch or when idle, based on users' recent app usage patterns and the apps' cache history. The preloaded apps remain cached until the user opens the app, resulting in a faster loading time.

If you enable precaching, your app utilizes resources, and telemetry data is tracked while in the precached state. To learn how to optimize your app for precaching, see [best practices](#best-practices).

### Enable precaching for tab app

To enable precaching for your tab app, follow these steps:

1. [Enable app caching](#enable-app-caching).

1. Update your app manifest as follows:

    1. Set the value of `showLoadingIndicator` to `true`. This action ensures that Teams waits until your app sends `notifySuccess` to conclude the app load sequence during precaching. For more information, see [showLoadingIndicator](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md#showloadingindicator).

    1. Add the `backgroundLoadConfiguration` object and define the `contentUrl`.

        ```json
        {
        "backgroundLoadConfiguration": {
            "tabConfiguration": {
                "contentUrl": "https://www.contoso.com/content?host=msteams&isBackgroundLoad=true"
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > * The `contentUrl` can't contain context-specific parameters, such as team site URL or thread ID, as Teams loads apps with no prior context during launch.
        > * The `contentUrl` must be generic enough to load in the background without any user interaction.

        For more information, see [backgroundLoadConfiguration](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md#backgroundloadconfiguration).

### Monitor background loading

You can identify if Teams loaded the app in the background without user interaction if you monitor the `isBackgroundLoad` property. If the property's state is `true`, it indicates that Teams has loaded the app in the background and isn't able to interact with the user. Hence, the app doesn't need to render UI elements such as sign-in prompts.

Monitor the `isBackgroundLoad` property in the app context to optimize the app for effective precache loading and rendering. For more information, see [isBackgroundLoad](/javascript/api/%40microsoft/teams-js/app.pageinfo?view=msteams-client-js-latest#@microsoft-teams-js-app-pageinfo-isbackgroundload&preserve-view=true).

## Best practices

The following are the best practices for app caching and precaching:

* We recommend that you implement web storage or service worker capabilities to store the data or webview locally. This helps to load the app faster in subsequent launches.

* Register the `beforeUnload` and `onLoad` handlers right after calling `app.initialize` and before the app sends `notifySuccess`. If the Teams client doesn’t see these registrations before the user leaves the app, the app isn't cached.

* Precaching increases the traffic to your app in addition to user-initiated requests. Ensure that the endpoint you provide as the `contentUrl` can handle background requests multiple times for each user in a day. Ensure that you make telemetry adjustments needed to accommodate the background loading of the app.

* Ensure that your app uses less than or equal to 130 MB of memory in the precached state.

## Limitations

The following are the limitations for app caching:

* Single-page apps that use client-side routing for page navigation can benefit from app caching. It's recommended that the same domain be used across all contexts of your app launch.

* Apps need to re-register for events such as `themeChange`, `focusEnter`, and so on, in the load handler. Teams client won't send any notifications to the app when cached. If your app requires notifications even when cached, caching might not be the right solution.

* The Teams client invokes the `loadHandler` only after the `unload` sequence of the app is completed. For example, if a user launches tab A of your app and then launches tab B of the same app, tab B won't get the load signal until the tab A invokes the `readyToUnload` callback.

* Apps are cached on a per-window basis. App caching happens on a per app (not on a per tab) basis within the same window.

* App caching isn't supported for the meeting stage or dialog (referred as task module in TeamsJS v1.x) contexts, because these can be opened on top of the tab and the same iframe or webview can't be used to render the content in the tab and the dialog.

* Register only the `beforeUnload` handler if your app doesn't require app caching but needs time to safely save state (as leaving the app can cause the app content to be abruptly removed from the Document Object Model (DOM)). If the app hasn't registered for the `load` event, it's removed from the DOM after the `unload` flow completes.

* Follow the guidelines in this section to onboard your app to app caching in Teams meeting. For app caching support only in meetings, register the `load` or `beforeUnload` handlers if the context is `sidePanel`.

* Apps are expected to sleep when cached (use minimal compute or network resources and minimizes SDK requests). All the register handlers and the following SDK requests are allowed when the app is cached:

  * `initialize`
  * `notifyappLoaded`
  * `notifySuccess`
  * `notifyFailure`
  * `notifyExpectedFailure`
  * `getContext`
  * `getAuthToken`
  * `readyToUnload`
  * `getConfig/getSettings`

## Troubleshooting

**Apps are not being cached? Why is load handler not invoked on subsequent navigation?**

* Verify if the system and available memory constraints are met.

* Reduce your memory footprint when cached. Use the `beforeUnload` handler to dispose resources, for example, release references and remove event listeners that might not be needed when cached.

# Add Teams tab to SharePoint

Experience a rich integration experience between Microsoft Teams and SharePoint by adding a Microsoft Teams tab in SharePoint as a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part. This document guides you on how to take a tab from a Microsoft Teams sample app and use it in SharePoint. With the latest release of Teams and SPFx, you have the following two capabilities:

- [SharePoint web parts in Teams](#sharepoint-web-parts-in-teams)
- [Teams tabs in SharePoint](#teams-tabs-in-sharepoint)

## SharePoint web parts in Teams

SharePoint hosts SPFx web parts without the need for external services like Azure. For SharePoint developers, this feature simplifies the development process for Teams tabs. For more information on SPFx in Teams, see [how to use the SharePoint Framework in Teams.](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/using-web-part-as-ms-teams-tab)

## Teams tabs in SharePoint

You can host your Teams tabs in SharePoint with SPFx. When hosted in SharePoint, Teams tabs provide a full-page experience. They retain the features of Teams tabs while maintaining the context and familiarity of a SharePoint site.

### Benefits

- Reach SharePoint users with your existing Teams tab.
- Upload your app manifest directly to your SharePoint App Catalog. SharePoint supports [Teams application packages](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
- Configure the tab on a page just like any other SharePoint web part.
- Access the [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) of your tab the same way it does when running in Teams.

## Test the sample app

1. Download the [sample app manifest](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-hello-world/csharp/demo-manifest/app-hello-world.zip).

2. In Teams, select **Apps** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**.

3. Select **Upload a custom app**.

> [!NOTE]
> SharePoint extension commands arenâ€™t supported in the Teams **Files** tab. You can [add a SharePoint page, list, or document library as a tab in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-sharepoint-page-list-or-document-library-as-a-tab-in-teams-131edef1-455f-4c67-a8ce-efa2ebf25f0b).

### Use Teams tab in SharePoint

1. Upload and deploy your Teams app package to your SharePoint App Catalog by visiting `https://YOUR_TENANT_NAME.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog/AppCatalog/Forms/AllItems.aspx`. For example, `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog/AppCatalog/Forms/AllItems.aspx`.

    - When prompted, enable **Make this solution available to all sites in the organization**.

        :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tabs-in-sharepoint/image065.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the deploy dialog.":::

1. You must then create a new page in your site. To create a new page, select the gear icon and then select **Add a page**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tabs-in-sharepoint/image066.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Office 365 settings options.":::

1. Set up your page and give an appropriate name such as **My Teams Tab**.

1. Open the web part toolbox and select **+**.

1. From the dropdown list, search and select the app you uploaded. It creates a web part in the canvas that contains your Teams tab.

### Explore Single Part App Pages in SharePoint

After you publish your page, explore [Single Part App Pages in SharePoint](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/single-part-app-pages). This article helps you convert the current page into a Single Part App Page, a normal SharePoint page layout with the full page experience for the Teams tab.

# Add Teams tab to SharePoint

Experience a rich integration of Microsoft Teams and SharePoint by adding a Teams tab as a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part. This article guides you on how to integrate a tab from a Teams sample app into SharePoint. With the latest release of Teams and SPFx, you have the following two capabilities:

- [SharePoint web parts in Teams](#sharepoint-web-parts-in-teams)
- [Teams tabs in SharePoint](#teams-tabs-in-sharepoint)

## SharePoint web parts in Teams

SharePoint hosts SPFx web parts without the need for external services such as Azure. For SharePoint developers, this functionality simplifies the development process for Teams tabs. For more information, see [how to use the SharePoint Framework in Teams](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/using-web-part-as-ms-teams-tab).

## Teams tabs in SharePoint

With SPFx, you can host your Teams tabs directly in SharePoint that provides a full-page experience. It retains the functionality of Teams tabs while maintaining the context and familiarity of a SharePoint site.

### Benefits

- Reach SharePoint users with your existing Teams tab.
- Upload your app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) directly to your SharePoint App Catalog. SharePoint supports [Teams app package](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
- Configure the tab on a page just like any other SharePoint web part.
- Access the [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) of your tab the same way it does when running in Teams.

## Test the sample app

1. Download the [sample app manifest](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-hello-world/csharp/demo-manifest/app-hello-world.zip).

1. In Teams, select **Apps** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**.

1. Select **Upload a custom app**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tabs-in-sharepoint/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

1. Select the sample app manifest .zip file and select **Open**. A dialog opens to add the custom app.

1. Under the **Add** dropdown, select **Add to a team**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tabs-in-sharepoint/custom-tab-add-to-team.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add a custom app to a team.":::

> [!NOTE]
> SharePoint extension commands arenâ€™t supported in the Teams **Files** tab. You can [add a SharePoint page, list, or document library as a tab in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-sharepoint-page-list-or-document-library-as-a-tab-in-teams-131edef1-455f-4c67-a8ce-efa2ebf25f0b).

### Use Teams tab in SharePoint

1. Upload and deploy your Teams app package to your SharePoint App Catalog by visiting `https://YOUR_TENANT_NAME.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog/AppCatalog/Forms/AllItems.aspx`.

    For example, `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog/AppCatalog/Forms/AllItems.aspx`.

    - When prompted, enable **Make this solution available to all sites in the organization**.

        :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tabs-in-sharepoint/image065.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the deploy dialog.":::

    You must then create a new page in your site.

1. To create a new page, select **Settings** :::image type="icon" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tabs-in-sharepoint/gear-icon.png" border="false"::: and select **Add a page**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tabs-in-sharepoint/image066.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Office 365 settings options.":::

1. Set up your page and give an appropriate name such as **My Teams Tab**.

1. Select **+** to open the web part toolbox.

1. From the list, search and select the app you uploaded. It creates a web part in the canvas that contains your Teams tab.

1. After you finish editing, select **Publish**.

1. Select **Add page to navigation** to have a quick reference to your page in the left navigation bar.

### Explore single part app pages in SharePoint

After you publish your page, explore [single part app pages in SharePoint](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/single-part-app-pages). This helps you convert the current page into a single part app page, a normal SharePoint page layout with the full-page experience for the Teams tab.

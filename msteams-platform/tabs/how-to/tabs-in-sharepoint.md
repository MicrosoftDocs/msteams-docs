# Add Teams tab to SharePoint

Get a rich integration experience between Microsoft Teams and SharePoint by adding a Microsoft Teams tab in SharePoint as a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part. This document guides you on how to take a tab from a Microsoft Teams sample app and use it in SharePoint. With the latest release of Teams and SPFx, you have the following two capabilities:

- [Teams tabs in SharePoint](#teams-tabs-in-sharepoint)
- [SharePoint web parts in Teams](#sharepoint-web-parts-in-teams)

## Teams tabs in SharePoint

You can host your Teams tabs in SharePoint with SPFx. Tabs hosted in SharePoint get a full-page experience, with the features of Teams tabs visible, while retaining the context and familiarity of a SharePoint site.

### Benefits

- Reach SharePoint users with your existing Teams tab.
- Upload your app manifest directly to your SharePoint App Catalog. SharePoint supports [Teams application packages](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md).
- Users can configure the tab on a page just like any other SharePoint web part.
- Your tab can access its [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) same as it can when running in Teams.

## SharePoint web parts in Teams

SharePoint hosts SPFx web parts without the need for external services like Azure. For SharePoint developers, this feature simplifies the development process for Teams tabs. For more information on SPFx in Teams, see [how to use the SharePoint Framework in Teams.](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/using-web-part-as-ms-teams-tab)

## Test the sample app

1. Download the [sample app manifest](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/app-HR-talent/csharp/src/demo-manifest).

   It's a talent management app that manages the hiring process of candidates for open positions in a team.

2. In Teams, select **Apps** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**.

3. Select **Upload a custom app**.

### Explore Single Part App Pages in SharePoint

After you publish your page, explore [Single Part App Pages in SharePoint](/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/single-part-app-pages). This article helps you convert the current page into a Single Part App Page, a normal SharePoint page layout with the full page experience for the Teams tab.

# Create a tab

Tabs in chats, channels, or meetings behave more like apps, as you can pin only one tab per app to the left pane for easy access.

## Developer experience for building a Teams tab app

Step-by-step to a Devâ€™s progress in building a Teams tab app and important information they may need:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tab-images/tab-progress-1.png" alt-text="Developer progress for building tab apps":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * We've introduced the [Teams Toolkit Overview](../../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md) extension within Visual Studio Code. This version comes to you with many new app development features. We recommend that you use Teams Toolkit v5 for building your Teams app.

Ensure that you've all the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build your tab.

Ensure that you've followed the prerequisites.
<details>
<summary>Select to view the prerequisites:</summary>

Ensure that you adhere to the following prerequisites while building your Teams personal and channel or group tab:

* Enable discovery of your tab pages in an iFrame by utilizing X-Frame-Options and [Content-Security-Policy HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) response headers.

* Ensure that all Teams app pages are hosted on HTTPS endpoints.

* Set Content Security Policy headers to allow Teams and any other [host applications](../../m365-apps/overview.md) of your app:

  [!INCLUDE [CSP headers for multi-hub apps](~/includes/tabs/content-security-policy-headers.md)]

  [!INCLUDE [ocdi-warning](../../includes/tabs/ocdi-warning.md)]

  > [!NOTE]
  > To host the other Teams or Microsoft 365 apps within your app, upgrade your app to a [Microsoft 365 environment](~/m365-apps/overview.md). If you manage the app running in the nested frame, you can update its code to initialize the SDK by specifying your domain. Your nested frame acts as a proxy to Teams.

* For Internet Explorer 11 compatibility, set `X-Content-Security-Policy`. Alternately, set header `X-Frame-Options: ALLOW-FROM https://teams.microsoft.com/`. This header is deprecated but most browsers still accept it.

* Sign-in pages don't render in iFrames as a safeguard against clickjacking. Your authentication logic needs to use a method other than redirect. For example, use token-based or cookie-based authentication.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is recommended that you set the intended use for your cookies rather than rely on default browser behavior. For more information, see [SameSite cookie attribute](../../resources/samesite-cookie-update.md).

* Browsers same-origin policy restriction prevents webpages from making requests to different domains than the served web page. So, you can redirect the configuration or content page to another domain or subdomain. Your cross-domain navigation logic needs to allow the Teams client to validate the origin against a static `validDomains` list in the [app manifest](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#validdomains) when loading or communicating with the tab.

* Style your tabs based on the Teams client's theme, design, and intent. Tabs work best when built to address a specific need and focus on a small set of tasks or a subset of data that is relevant to the tab's channel location.

* Within your content page, add a reference to [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client#microsoft-teams-javascript-client-library) using script tags. After your page loads, make a call to `app.initialize()`, or else your page isn't displayed.

* For authentication to work on mobile clients, you must upgrade to TeamsJS version 1.4.1 or later.

* If you choose to have your channel or group tab to appear on Teams mobile client, the `setConfig()` configuration must have a value for the `websiteUrl` property.

* Microsoft Teams tab doesn't support the ability to load intranet websites that use self-signed certificates.

### Add a content page to the tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the tab application:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in your Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **public** folder in the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in your Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and add the following JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value that you entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then **/MyTabTab/**

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with your actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in your Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide your content page in an iFrame:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of iFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. Your tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, use the command `gulp manifest`.

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt, enter the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser to view your application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab":::

1. Browse `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/personal.html`, to view your tab.

## Static and personal tabs

You can build two types of tabs within your Microsoft Teams tab app:

* **Static tabs**:

  Static tabs are shared tabs that can be available to members of a channel or team. Teams owners or administrators can configure the tab's content. It's suitable for shared resources like dashboard or knowledge base.

* **Personal tabs**:

  Personal tabs are visible only to individuals who add the tab app. The user can configure their own personalized content and configuration. It's suitable for to-do lists or personal note taking apps.

Here's how you can add and configure tabs:

* [Extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings](#extend-static-tabs-to-group-chat-channels-and-meetings)
* [Customizing your static tab in chats or meetings](#customizing-your-static-tab-in-chats-or-meetings)
* [Personal offline tabs](#personal-offline-tabs)

### Extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To extend your static tab to group chat, channels, and meetings, use the app manifest v1.16 or later.

You can extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings. Instead of pinned app content, you can build tabs that behave more like apps as you can pin only one tab per app, for example, pinning a single YouTube app tab.

To extend your static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings, update your [app manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#statictabs) with the `scopes` and `context` parameters in the `staticTabs` property. When you declare multiple static tabs in the manifest and add the app in the channel scope, only the first tab listed in the manifest appears.

Following is an example of app manifest where a static tab is defined that works in all scopes and contexts in Teams:

```json
"staticTabs": [ 
  { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal", 
       "groupChat", 
       "team"
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab",
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
  }
], 

```

If a context isn't defined in the app manifest, by default Teams consider the following context:

```json
"context": [ 
   "personalTab",
   "channelTab",
   "privateChatTab", 
   "meetingChatTab", 
   "meetingDetailsTab", 
   "meetingStage" 
]
```

### Customizing your static tab in chats or meetings

To customize your static tab experience in chats, channels, or meetings, you can use the `setConfig` APIs in your tab to update the `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl`. Following is an example:

```json
pages.config.setConfig({ 
  "contentUrl": "https://wwww.contoso.com/teamsapp/thread/" + context.threadId,
   ...}

```

Only `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl` changes are supported for `setConfig`, other properties can't be changed for static tabs.

### Personal offline tabs

> [!NOTE]
> Personal tabs with offline functionality are only supported on Teams in Android devices.

You can create a personal tab that works in Teams without an internet connection. An offline tab benefits users who work in areas with poor or no network coverage, such as field agents or frontline workers. Users can perform the following tasks in an offline tab:

* Record data through forms that can include images and videos.
* View details of previously submitted requests, incidents, or forms.

When the user's device reconnects to the internet, the tab automatically synchronizes the locally stored data with an Azure Blob storage. This action ensures that all offline changes made by the user are updated in a central storage, maintaining data consistency across the organization.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tab-support-offline-mobile.gif" alt-text="Graphic shows how an offline tab works in Teams mobile client.":::

#### Build an offline tab

Before you get started with building an offline tab, ensure that you meet the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build a personal tab.

1. [Create an Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal). Ensure that you note down the account and container name for later use.

1. Clone the [Microsoft Teams Samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/) repository.

1. In the cloned repository, go to **samples** > **tab-support-offline** > **nodejs** and open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to open the code sample in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png":::

1. Under **EXPLORER**, go to **server** > **blobStoreOperations.js** and replace `{{ account-Name }}` and `{{ container-Name }}` with your Azure Blob storage account and container's values.

1. Select the **F5** key to debug the app. Teams opens in a browser window when the build is complete.

1. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account, if prompted.

1. Select **Add** when a dialog box opens to let you add the tab app to Teams.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/add-offline-tab-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add the offline tab app to Teams.":::

Congratulations! You've successfully created a Teams tab with offline functionality.

## Reorder tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers can rearrange all tabs in their personal app. You can move the **bot chat** tab, which always defaults to the first position, anywhere in the personal app tab header. Two reserved tab `entityId` keywords are declared, **conversations** and **about**.

If you create a bot with a **personal** scope, it appears in the first tab position in a personal app by default. If you want to move it to another position, you must add a static tab object to your manifest with the reserved keyword, **conversations**. The **conversation** tab appears on web and desktop depending on where you add the **conversation** tab in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON

{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

```

> [!NOTE]
> In mobile, tabs are reordered as defined in `staticTabs`.

This property also enables you to set the default landing capability for your app. You can configure the app to open as a tab or a bot by default. For more information, see [configure default landing capability](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/add-default-install-scope.md#configure-your-apps-default-landing-capability).

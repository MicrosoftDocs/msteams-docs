# Create a tab

Tabs in chats, channels, or meetings behave more like apps, as developers can pin only one tab per app to the left pane for easy access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Microsoft has introduced [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](../../toolkit/agents-toolkit-fundamentals.md) (previously known as Teams Toolkit) extension within Visual Studio Code. This version comes with many new app development features. Agents Toolkit v5 is recommended for building Teams apps.

Developers should ensure that all the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build the tab are met.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]

### Add a content page to the tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the tab application as follows:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **public** folder at the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and insert the JSON object exactly as shown:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: If DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then the path will be **/MyTabTab/**

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with the actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide your content page in an iFrame:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of iFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. Your tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

An app package is necessary to build and run the application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At a command prompt, run the following command:

```cmd
gulp manifest
```

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt, run the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in the browser to view the application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab":::

<details>
<summary><b>Review the source code</b></summary>

#### Startup.cs

The project uses an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** option selected during setup. The MVC services are registered in the `ConfigureServices()` method via dependency injection. Since the empty template does not enable serving static content by default, the static files middleware is added in the `Configure()` method as shown below:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, this folder (wwwroot) serves as the web root location where the application looks for static files.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files named **Index** as the default home page. Thus when the browser URL accesses the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is rendered.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder holds the necessary app package files:

* A full color icon with dimensions 192 x 192 pixels.
* A transparent outline icon with dimensions 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that defines the attributes of the app.

These files are zipped into an app package used to upload the tab into Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` from the manifest, embeds it in an <iframe>, and renders it within the tab.

#### .csproj

In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the project and choose **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, code similar to the following is present to create and update your zip folder during the build process:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

These files are zipped into an app package for uploading to Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` from your manifest, embeds it in an iFrame, and renders it in your tab.

#### .csproj

Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, observe the following code that creates and updates a zip folder when the application builds:

``` xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

#### Models

The file **PersonalTab.cs** contains a message object and methods, which are invoked from **PersonalTabController** when the user selects a button in the **PersonalTab** view.

#### Views

These views comprise the various screens in the ASP.NET Core MVC application:

* Home: ASP.NET Core treats any file called **Index** as the default home page. When the browser URL points to the root, **Index.cshtml** is rendered as the home page.
* Shared: The partial view **_Layout.cshtml** contains the overall page structure and shared elements, and also references the Teams Library.

#### Controllers

Controllers utilize the `ViewBag` property to transfer dynamic values to the Views.

## Set up your Teams development tenant

A tenant acts as a space or container for an organization in Teams where developers and users collaborate through chat, file sharing, and meetings. It is also where custom apps are uploaded and tested. Verify that the tenant is ready for development.

### Enable custom app upload

Once the app is created, it must be loaded in Teams without distribution. This process, known as custom app upload, requires signing in with a Microsoft 365 account.

To verify if custom app upload is enabled in Teams:

1. In the Teams client, select **Apps**.
1. Click **Manage your apps**.
1. Choose **Upload an app**. If the option **Upload a custom app** is visible, custom app upload is enabled.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/blazor/upload-custom-app.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Contact the Teams administrator if the option to upload a custom app is missing.

### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

If a Teams developer account is not available, sign up for one at no cost by joining the Microsoft 365 developer program.

1. Visit the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
1. Click **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
1. On the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
1. Set up the administrator account. Once complete, the following screen is displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft 365 Developer Program displaying Microsoft 365 developer subscriptions for the Blazor app.":::

1. Sign in to Teams using the newly created administrator account and verify that the **Upload a custom app** option is available.

## Get a free Azure account

For hosting the app or accessing Azure resources, an Azure subscription is required. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before beginning.

With all the necessary tools and accounts in place, developers can now set up the development environment and start building.

## Congratulations

Developers have completed the tutorial to build a tab app with Blazor.

::: zone-end

## Reorder tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers can rearrange all tabs in a personal app. The **bot chat** tab, which defaults to the first position, can be moved anywhere in the personal app tab header. Two reserved tab `entityId` keywords are declared: **conversations** and **about**.

If a bot with a **personal** scope is created, it appears in the first tab position by default. To reposition it, add a static tab object to the manifest using the reserved keyword **conversations**. The **conversation** tab appears on web and desktop based on its placement in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON
{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         // other tab details can be placed here
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> On mobile, tabs are reordered as defined in `staticTabs`.

This property also allows the default landing capability for the app to be set. Developers can configure the app to open as a tab or as a bot by default. For additional details, see [configure default landing capability](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/add-default-install-scope.md#configure-your-apps-default-landing-capability).

## Extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings, use app manifest v1.16 or later.

Static tabs can be extended beyond personal scope to group chats, channels, and meetings. Instead of including pinned app content, developers can build tabs that behave more like apps by pinning only a single tab per app (for example, a YouTube app tab).

To extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings, update the [app manifest](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/root-static-tabs) with both the `scopes` and `context` parameters for the `staticTabs` property. When multiple static tabs are declared in the manifest and the app is added in the channel scope, only the first tab listed in the manifest is displayed.

Below is an example app manifest where a static tab is defined to work in all scopes and contexts in Teams:

```json
"staticTabs": [ 
  { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal", 
       "groupChat", 
       "team"
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab",
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
  }
], 
```

If a context array is omitted in the manifest, Teams will by default consider the following contexts:

```json
"context": [ 
   "personalTab",
   "channelTab",
   "privateChatTab", 
   "meetingChatTab", 
   "meetingDetailsTab", 
   "meetingStage" 
]
```

## Enable personal tab apps for calling extensibility

Developers can create personal scope apps that integrate with Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and Teams-to-Teams calls. Use the appropriate scope and context to build apps that utilize the tab type, static scope, personal context, and meeting side panels.

For more details, see [build tabs for calling](../../apps-in-teams-meetings/build-tabs-for-calling.md).

## Customizing your static tab in chats or meetings

To customize the static tab experience in chats, channels, or meetings, developers can use the `setConfig` APIs to update the `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl`. For example:

```json
pages.config.setConfig({ 
  "contentUrl": "https://wwww.contoso.com/teamsapp/thread/" + context.threadId,
  // other configuration properties can be included as needed
})
```

Only changes to `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl` are supported with `setConfig`; other properties cannot be modified for static tabs.

## Offline tabs

> [!NOTE]
> Personal tabs with offline functionality are only supported on Teams for Android devices.

Developers can create personal tabs that function without an internet connection. Offline tabs are beneficial for users operating in areas with limited or no network connectivity, such as field agents or frontline workers. With an offline tab, users can:

* Record data via forms that may include images and videos.
* View details of previously submitted requests, incidents, or forms.

When the device reconnects to the internet, the tab automatically synchronizes the locally stored data with Azure Blob storage. This synchronization ensures that all offline changes are updated centrally, maintaining data consistency across the organization.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tab-support-offline-mobile.gif" alt-text="Graphic shows how an offline tab works in Teams mobile client.":::

### Build an offline tab

Before building the offline tab, ensure that all the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build a personal tab are met.

1. [Create an Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal). Make sure to note the account name and container name for later configuration.

1. Clone the [Microsoft Teams Samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/) repository.

1. In the cloned repository, navigate to **samples** > **tab-support-offline** > **nodejs** and open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to open the code sample in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png":::

1. Under **EXPLORER**, locate **server** > **blobStoreOperations.js** and replace the placeholders `{{ account-Name }}` and `{{ container-Name }}` with your Azure Blob storage account and container values.

1. Press **F5** to debug the app. Once the build is complete, Teams will open in a browser window.

1. If prompted, sign in with the Microsoft 365 account.

1. When prompted with a dialog box, select **Add** to add the tab app to Teams.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/add-offline-tab-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add the offline tab app to Teams.":::

Congratulations! The Teams tab with offline functionality has been successfully created.

# Create a tab

Tabs in chats, channels, or meetings behave like apps, allowing only one tab per app to be pinned to the left pane for quick access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Microsoft has introduced [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](../../toolkit/agents-toolkit-fundamentals.md) (previously known as Teams Toolkit) extension within Visual Studio Code. This version offers many new app development features. It is recommended to use Agents Toolkit v5 for building Teams apps.

Ensure that all the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) for building a tab are satisfied.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]

## Create a tab with JavaScript

Follow the step-by-step guide to [build your tab app using JavaScript](../../sbs-gs-javascript.yml).

<!--
1. At the command prompt, install the [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) packages by entering the following command after installing Node.js:

    ```cmd
    npm install yo gulp-cli --global
    ```

1. At the command prompt, install Microsoft Teams app generator by entering the following command:

    ```cmd
    npm install generator-teams --global
    ```

Following are the steps to create a tab:

1. [Generate your application with a tab](#generate-your-application-with-a-tab)
1. [Add a content page to the tab](#add-a-content-page-to-the-tab)
1. [Create your app package](#create-your-app-package)
1. [Build and run your application](#build-and-run-your-application)
1. [Establish a secure tunnel to your tab](#establish-a-secure-tunnel-to-your-tab)
1. [Upload your application to Teams](#upload-your-application-to-teams)

### Generate your application with a tab

1. At the command prompt, create a new directory for your tab.

1. Enter the following command in your new directory to start the Microsoft Teams app generator:

### Add a content page to the tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the tab application:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in the application's **public** folder at the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following JSON object to the empty `staticTabs` array (`"staticTabs":[]`):

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** appended with the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: If DefaultTabName is **MyTab**, then the path is **/MyTabTab/**.

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with the actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide the content page in an iframe:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of iframe decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. The tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

An app package is required to build and run the application in Teams. The app package is created by a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates a zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, run the command `gulp manifest`.

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile the solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt, run the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in a browser to view the application home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab":::

#### Startup.cs

This project is built from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** option selected during setup. The MVC services are registered using the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, since the empty template does not enable serving static content by default, the static files middleware is added in the `Configure()` method with the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where static files are stored.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files named **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When the browser URL targets the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the required app package files:

* A full color icon with dimensions of 192 x 192 pixels.
* A transparent outline icon with dimensions of 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the app's attributes.

These files must be zipped into an app package for uploading the tab to Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` specified in the manifest, embeds it in an <iframe>, and renders it within the tab.

#### .csproj

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, the following code is used to create and update the zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>

``` xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

#### Models

**PersonalTab.cs** presents a message object and associated methods that are invoked from **PersonalTabController** when a user selects a button from the **PersonalTab** view.

#### Views

These views represent different pages in ASP.NET Core MVC:

* Home: ASP.NET Core treats files named **Index** as the default or home page. When the browser targets the root URL, **Index.cshtml** displays as the home page.
* Shared: The partial view **_Layout.cshtml** establishes the overall page structure and shared visual elements. It also references the Teams Library.

#### Controllers

Controllers use the `ViewBag` property to dynamically pass values to the Views.

## Congratulations

The tutorial for building a tab app with Blazor is complete.

::: zone-end

## Reorder tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers can rearrange all tabs in a personal app. The **bot chat** tab, which defaults to the first position, can be moved anywhere in the personal app tab header. Two reserved `entityId` keywords are defined, **conversations** and **about**.

If a bot with a **personal** scope is created, it appears in the first tab position in a personal app by default. To move it, add a static tab object to the manifest with the reserved keyword **conversations**. The **conversations** tab appears on web and desktop based on its position in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON
{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> On mobile, tabs are reordered as defined in `staticTabs`.

This property also enables setting the default landing capability for the app. The app can be configured to open as a tab or a bot by default. For additional details, see [configure default landing capability](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/add-default-install-scope.md#configure-your-apps-default-landing-capability).

## Extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings, use app manifest v1.16 or later.

Static tabs can be extended to group chat, channels, and meetings. Instead of pinned app content, tabs can behave like apps by allowing only one tab per app, for example, pinning a single YouTube app tab.

To extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings, update the [app manifest](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/root-static-tabs) with `scopes` and `context` parameters in the `staticTabs` property. When multiple static tabs are declared in the manifest and the app is added in the channel scope, only the first tab listed appears.

Below is an example app manifest where a static tab is defined to work across all scopes and contexts in Teams:

```json
"staticTabs": [ 
  { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal", 
       "groupChat", 
       "team"
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab",
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
  }
], 
```

If a context is not defined in the app manifest, Teams uses the following default:

```json
"context": [ 
   "personalTab",
   "channelTab",
   "privateChatTab", 
   "meetingChatTab", 
   "meetingDetailsTab", 
   "meetingStage" 
]
```

## Enable personal tab apps for calling extensibility

Developers can create personal scope apps that integrate with Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and Teams-to-Teams calls. Use the appropriate scope and context to build apps that utilize tab type, static scope, personal context, and meeting side panels.

For further details, see [build tabs for calling](../../apps-in-teams-meetings/build-tabs-for-calling.md).

## Customizing your static tab in chats or meetings

To customize the static tab experience in chats, channels, or meetings, use the `setConfig` APIs in the tab to update `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl`. For example:

```json
pages.config.setConfig({ 
  "contentUrl": "https://wwww.contoso.com/teamsapp/thread/" + context.threadId,
   ...}
```

Only changes to `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl` are allowed with `setConfig`; other properties cannot be modified for static tabs.

## Offline tabs

> [!NOTE]
> Personal tabs with offline functionality are supported only on Teams for Android devices.

Developers can create a personal tab that operates in Teams without an internet connection. Offline tabs benefit users in areas with poor or no network coverage, such as field agents or frontline workers. Users can perform tasks like:

* Recording data through forms that may include images and videos.
* Viewing details of previously submitted requests, incidents, or forms.

When the device reconnects to the internet, the tab automatically synchronizes locally stored data with Azure Blob storage, ensuring that all offline changes are updated in central storage and data consistency is maintained across the organization.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tab-support-offline-mobile.gif" alt-text="Graphic shows how an offline tab works in Teams mobile client.":::

### Build an offline tab

Before building an offline tab, ensure that the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) for a personal tab are met.

1. [Create an Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal). Note the account and container names for later use.

1. Clone the [Microsoft Teams Samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/) repository.

1. In the cloned repository, navigate to **samples** > **tab-support-offline** > **nodejs** and open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to open the code sample in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png":::

1. Under **EXPLORER**, open **server** > **blobStoreOperations.js** and replace `{{ account-Name }}` and `{{ container-Name }}` with the Azure Blob storage account and container values.

1. Press **F5** to debug the app. Teams opens in a browser window once the build is complete.

1. Sign in with the Microsoft 365 account if prompted.

1. When the dialog box appears, select **Add** to incorporate the tab app into Teams.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/add-offline-tab-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add the offline tab app to Teams.":::

Congratulations! A Teams tab with offline functionality is created successfully.

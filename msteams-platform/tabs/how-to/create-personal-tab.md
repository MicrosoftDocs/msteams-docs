# Create a personal tab

Personal tabs, along with personally-scoped bots, are part of personal apps and are scoped to a single user. They can be pinned to the left pane for easy access. You can also [reorder](#reorder-static-personal-tabs) your personal tabs.

Ensure that you have all the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build your personal tab.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]

    ```cmd
    npm install yo gulp-cli --global
    ```

1. At the command prompt, install Microsoft Teams app generator by entering the following command:

    ```cmd
    npm install generator-teams --global
    ```

Following are the steps to create a personal tab:

1. [Generate your application with a personal tab](#generate-your-application-with-a-personal-tab)
1. [Add a content page to the personal tab](#add-a-content-page-to-the-personal-tab)

    > [!NOTE]
    > In a tab, the tab home page appears only when the user selects the back button (or moves out of the tab) and comes back to the home page. The tab doesn't maintain or retain the previous state by design.
    </details>

### Add a content page to the personal tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the personal tab application:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in your Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **public** folder in the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in your Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and add the following JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value that you entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then **/MyTabTab/**

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with your actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in your Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide your content page in an iFrame:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of iFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. Your tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, use the command `gulp manifest`.

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt, enter the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser to view your application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab":::

1. Browse `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/personal.html`, to view your personal tab.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/personalTab.PNG" alt-text="Default html Tab":::

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt exit the localhost and enter the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

After your tab is uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok** and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends.

### Upload your application to Teams

1. Go to Teams and select **Apps**&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/store.png" alt-text="Teams Store":::.
1. Select **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app** > **Upload a custom app**.
1. Go to your project directory, browse to the **./package** folder, select the zip folder, and choose **Open**.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/addingpersonaltab.png" alt-text="Adding your personal tab":::

1. Select **Add** in the dialog. Your tab is uploaded to Teams.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/personaltabuploaded.png" alt-text="Personal tab uploaded":::

1. In the left pane of Teams, select ellipses &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; and then choose your uploaded app to view your personal tab.

   Now you've successfully created and added your personal tab in Teams.
  
   As you have your personal tab in Teams, you can also [reorder](#reorder-static-personal-tabs) your personal tab.

#### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

* A full color icon measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
* A transparent outline icon measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files must be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` specified in your manifest, embeds it in an <iframe\>, and renders it in your tab.

#### .csproj

In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you can see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">

   As you have your personal tab in Teams, you can also [reorder](#reorder-static-personal-tabs) your personal tab.

::: zone-end

## Reorder static personal tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers can rearrange all tabs in their personal app. You can move the **bot chat** tab, which always defaults to the first position, anywhere in the personal app tab header. Two reserved tab `entityId` keywords are declared, **conversations** and **about**.

If you create a bot with a **personal** scope, it appears in the first tab position in a personal app by default. If you want to move it to another position, you must add a static tab object to your manifest with the reserved keyword, **conversations**. The **conversation** tab appears on web or desktop depending on where you add the **conversation** tab in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON

{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

```

## Extend personal tabs to group chat and channels

You can extend personal tabs to group chat, channel, and meetings. These tabs behave more like apps, instead of pinned app content as there will only ever be one tab pinned at a time. Keep the following things in mind to build a personal tab that works in every context:

* Don't embed your entire web app in Teams, as users often don't find this valuable.
* Instead, think about what your app can uniquely do inside of Teams. For example, can you serve an app experience that consolidates all your apps content, such as displaying all the surveys in a meeting.
* Your app needs to be responsive down to 320 pixels width since your app will be loaded in the meeting side panel and on mobile devices. 

To extend your personal tabs to group chat and channels, update your [app manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#statictabs) with respective `scopes` and `context` parameters in the `staticTabs` property 

Following is an example app manifest where a personal tab is defined that will work in all scopes and contexts in Teams:

```json
"staticTabs": [ 
  { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal", 
       "team", 
       "groupChat" 
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab", 
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
  }
], 

```

If a context isn't defined in the app manifest, then Teams will default to the following:

```json
"context": [ 
   "personalTab", 
   "channelTab", 
   "privateChatTab", 
   "meetingChatTab", 
   "meetingDetailsTab", 
   "meetingStage" 
]

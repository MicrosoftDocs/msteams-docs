# Create a personal tab

Personal tabs, along with personally scoped bots, are part of personal apps and are scoped to a single user. They can be pinned to the left pane for easy access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * To learn how to create a tab with Teams Toolkit, see [build your first tab app using JavaScript](../../sbs-gs-javascript.yml).
> * We've introduced the [Teams Toolkit Overview](../../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md) extension within Visual Studio Code. This version comes to you with many new app development features. We recommend that you use Teams Toolkit v5 for building your Teams app.

Ensure that you've all the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build your personal tab.

    </details>

### Add a content page to the personal tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the personal tab application:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in your Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **public** folder in the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in your Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and add the following JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value that you entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then **/MyTabTab/**

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with your actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in your Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide your content page in an iFrame:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of iFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. Your tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, use the command `gulp manifest`.

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt, enter the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser to view your application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab":::

1. Browse `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/personal.html`, to view your personal tab.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/personalTab.PNG" alt-text="Default html Tab":::

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt exit the localhost and enter the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

After your tab is uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok** and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends.

### Upload your application to Teams

1. Go to Teams and select **Apps**&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/store.png" alt-text="Microsoft Teams Store":::.
1. Select **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app** > **Upload a custom app**.

#### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

* A full color icon measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
* A transparent outline icon measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files must be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` specified in your manifest, embeds it in an <iframe\>, and renders it in your tab.

#### .csproj

In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you can see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>

#### Views

These views are the different views in ASP.NET Core MVC:

* Home: ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

* Shared: The partial view markup **_Layout.cshtml** contains the application's overall page structure and shared visual elements. It also references the Teams Library.

#### Controllers

The controllers use the `ViewBag` property to transfer values dynamically to the Views.

sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
 ```

This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the remote signed execution policy for PowerShell.

## Set up your Teams development tenant

A tenant is like a space or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you upload and test your custom app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

### Enable custom app upload option

After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

Do you already have a tenant and the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

Verify if you can upload a custom app in Teams:

1. In the Teams client, select **Apps**.
1. Select **Manage your apps**.
1. Select **Upload a custom app**. If you see **Upload a custom app** option, custom app upload is enabled.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor/upload-custom-app.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Contact your Teams administrator, if you don't find the option to upload a custom app.

### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it for free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft 365 Developer Program displaying your Microsoft 365 developer subscriptions for the Blazor app.":::

1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you've the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

## Get a free Azure account

If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

Now you've got all the tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

## Reorder static personal tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers can rearrange all tabs in their personal app. You can move the **bot chat** tab, which always defaults to the first position, anywhere in the personal app tab header. Two reserved tab `entityId` keywords are declared, **conversations** and **about**.

If you create a bot with a **personal** scope, it appears in the first tab position in a personal app by default. If you want to move it to another position, you must add a static tab object to your manifest with the reserved keyword, **conversations**. The **conversation** tab appears on web or desktop depending on where you add the **conversation** tab in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON

{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

```

## Extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To extend your static tab to group chat, channels, and meetings, use the app manifest v1.16 or later.

You can extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings. Instead of pinned app content, you can build tabs that behave more like apps as you can pin only one tab per app, for example, pinning a single YouTube app tab.

To extend your static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings, update your [app manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#statictabs) with the `scopes` and `context` parameters in the `staticTabs` property.

Following is an example of app manifest where a static tab is defined that works in all scopes and contexts in Teams:

```json
"staticTabs": [ 
  { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal", 
       "groupChat", 
       "team"
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab",
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
  }
], 

```

If a context isn't defined in the app manifest, by default Teams consider the following context:

```json
"context": [ 
   "personalTab",
   "channelTab",
   "privateChatTab", 
   "meetingChatTab", 
   "meetingDetailsTab", 
   "meetingStage" 
]
```

## Customizing your static tab in chats or meetings

To customize your static tab experience in chats, channels, or meetings, you can use the `setConfig` APIs in your tab to update the `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl`. Following is an example:

```json
pages.config.setConfig({ 
  "contentUrl": "https://wwww.contoso.com/teamsapp/thread/" + context.threadId,
   ...}

```

Only `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl` changes are supported for `setConfig`, other properties can't be changed for static tabs.

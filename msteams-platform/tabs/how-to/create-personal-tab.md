# Create a tab

Tabs within chats, channels, or meetings function similarly to apps, as you can pin only one tab per app to the left pane for convenient access.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> We've introduced the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](../../toolkit/agents-toolkit-fundamentals.md), previously known as Teams Toolkit, as an extension within Visual Studio Code. This latest version is equipped with numerous new app development features. We strongly recommend using Agents Toolkit v5 for building your Teams app.

Ensure that you have all the necessary [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build your tab.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]

## Create a tab with JavaScript

Follow the detailed guide to [build your tab app using JavaScript](../../sbs-gs-javascript.yml).

<!--
1. At the command prompt, install the [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and [gulp-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) packages by entering the following command after installing Node.js:

    ```cmd
    npm install yo gulp-cli --global
    ```

1. At the command prompt, install the Microsoft Teams app generator by entering the following command:

    ```cmd
    npm install generator-teams --global
    ```

The following are the steps to create a tab:

1. [Generate your application with a tab](#generate-your-application-with-a-tab)
1. [Add a content page to the tab](#add-a-content-page-to-the-tab)
1. [Create your app package](#create-your-app-package)
1. [Build and run your application](#build-and-run-your-application)
1. [Establish a secure tunnel to your tab](#establish-a-secure-tunnel-to-your-tab)
1. [Upload your application to Teams](#upload-your-application-to-teams)

### Generate your application with a tab

1. At the command prompt, create a new directory for your tab.

1. Enter the following command in your new directory to start the Microsoft Teams app generator:

    ```cmd
    yo teams
    ```

1. Provide your values to a series of questions prompted by the Microsoft Teams app generator to update your `manifest.json` file.

### Add a content page to the tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the tab application:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in your Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **public** folder in the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in your Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and add the following JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value that you entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then **/MyTabTab/**

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with your actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in your Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide your content page in an iFrame:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of iFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. Your tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, use the command `gulp manifest`.

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt, enter the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser to view your application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab":::

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt, exit the localhost and enter the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

After your tab is uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok** and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends.

### Upload your application to Teams

1. Go to Teams and select **Apps**&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/store.png" alt-text="Microsoft Teams Store":::.
1. Select **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app** > **Upload a custom app**.

<details>
<summary><b>Review the source code</b></summary>

#### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

* A full color icon measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
* A transparent outline icon measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files must be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` specified in your manifest, embeds it in an <iframe\>, and renders it in your tab.

#### .csproj

In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you can see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt in the root of your project directory, run the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
ngrok http 3978 --host-header=localhost
```

### Update your app package with Developer Portal

1. Go to [**Developer portal**](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/home).

1. Open **Apps** and select **Import app**.


1. The app package file is named `tab.zip`, and you can find it at the path `/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1/tab.zip`. This file is crucial for the next steps in the app development process.

1. To proceed, select the `tab.zip` file and open it within the Developer Portal. This action is essential for further configuration and customization of your app.

1. Upon opening the app package, a default **App ID** is automatically generated and displayed in the **Basic information** section. This ID is a unique identifier for your app within the Microsoft Teams environment.

1. You need to provide both a Short and Long description for your app under the **Descriptions** section. These descriptions help users understand the purpose and functionality of your app.

1. In the **Developer Information** section, input all necessary details. Additionally, for the **Website (must be a valid HTTPS URL)** field, enter your ngrok HTTPS URL. This URL is crucial as it serves as a secure endpoint for your app.

1. Navigate to the **App URLs** section and update the Privacy policy URL to `https://<yourngrokurl>/privacy` and the Terms of use URL to `https://<yourngrokurl>/tou`. After making these updates, select **Save** to ensure the changes are applied.

1. Within the **App features** section, choose **Personal app** and then select **Create your first personal app tab**. Here, you will enter the name of your tab and update the **Content URL** to `https://<yourngrokurl>/personalTab`. Leave the Website URL field empty, and from the dropdown list, select **Context** as personalTab. Finally, select **Confirm** to finalize these settings.

1. Remember to select **Save** to ensure all your configurations are stored correctly.

1. In the Domains section, ensure that the domains from your tabs include your ngrok URL, but without the HTTPS prefix. It should be formatted as `<yourngrokurl>.ngrok.io`. This step is vital for the correct operation of your app within Teams.

    ```cmd
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

The following steps outline the process to create a tab:

1. [Generate your application with a tab](#generate-your-application-with-a-tab)
1. [Update and run application](#update-and-run-your-application-1)
1. [Establish a secure tunnel to your tab](#establish-a-secure-tunnel-to-your-tab-2)
1. [Update your app package with Developer Portal](#update-your-app-package-with-developer-portal-1)
1. [Preview your app in Teams](#preview-your-app-in-teams-1)

### Generate your application with a tab

1. Launch Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution** to begin working with your project.

1. Navigate to the **Microsoft-Teams-Samples** > **samples** > **tab-personal** > **mvc-csharp** folder, and open the **PersonalTabMVC.sln** file in Visual Studio. This solution file contains all the necessary configurations for your project.

1. In Visual Studio, press **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu of your application. This action will verify if the application is loaded properly. In your web browser, visit the following URLs to confirm:

    * `<http://localhost:3978>`
    * `<http://localhost:3978/personalTab>`
    * `<http://localhost:3978/privacy>`
    * `<http://localhost:3978/tou>`

#### Startup.cs

This project originates from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template, with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** option selected during setup. The MVC services are registered using the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, since the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

``` csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is the designated location where the application searches for static files. This folder is crucial for serving static content like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the essential app package files required for your app:

* A **full color icon** with dimensions of 192 x 192 pixels.
* A **transparent outline icon** with dimensions of 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that outlines the attributes of your app.

These files must be compressed into a zip file to create an app package for uploading your tab to Teams. Teams will load the `contentUrl` specified in your manifest, embed it in an iFrame, and render it in your tab.

#### .csproj

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you will find the following code, which creates and updates your zip folder whenever the application builds:

``` xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

#### Models

**PersonalTab.cs** defines a message object and methods that are invoked from **PersonalTabController** when a user interacts with a button in the **PersonalTab** View.

#### Views

These views represent different perspectives in ASP.NET Core MVC:

* Home: ASP.NET Core treats files named **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

* Shared: The partial view markup **_Layout.cshtml** contains the application's overall page structure and shared visual elements. It also references the Teams Library.

#### Controllers

The controllers utilize the `ViewBag` property to dynamically pass values to the Views.

## Set up your Teams development tenant

A tenant is like a space or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you upload and test your custom app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

### Enable custom app upload

After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

Do you already have a tenant and the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

To verify if you can upload a custom app in Teams:

1. In the Teams client, select **Apps**.
1. Select **Manage your apps**.
1. Select **Upload an app**. If you see **Upload a custom app** option, custom app upload is enabled.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/toolkit-v2/blazor/upload-custom-app.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Contact your Teams administrator, if you don't find the option to upload a custom app.

### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it for free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft 365 Developer Program displaying your Microsoft 365 developer subscriptions for the Blazor app.":::

1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you've the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

## Get a free Azure account

If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) before you begin.

Now you've got all the tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

## Create project workspace for your tab app

## Congratulations

You've successfully completed the tutorial to build a tab app using Blazor.

::: zone-end

## Reorder tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers have the ability to rearrange all tabs within their personal app. You can move the **bot chat** tab, which defaults to the first position, to any location in the personal app tab header. Two reserved tab `entityId` keywords are declared: **conversations** and **about**.

If you create a bot with a **personal** scope, it will appear in the first tab position in a personal app by default. To move it to a different position, you must add a static tab object to your manifest with the reserved keyword, **conversations**. The **conversation** tab will appear on web and desktop depending on where you add the **conversation** tab in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON

{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

```

> [!NOTE]
> On mobile devices, tabs are reordered as defined in `staticTabs`.

This property also allows you to set the default landing capability for your app. You can configure the app to open as a tab or a bot by default. For more information, see [configure default landing capability](../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/add-default-install-scope.md#configure-your-apps-default-landing-capability).

## Extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To extend your static tab to group chat, channels, and meetings, use the app manifest v1.16 or later.

You can extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings. Instead of pinned app content, you can develop tabs that behave more like apps, as you can pin only one tab per app. For example, you can pin a single YouTube app tab.

To extend your static tabs to include group chat, channels, and meetings, you need to update your [app manifest](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/root-static-tabs) by incorporating the `scopes` and `context` parameters within the `staticTabs` property. When you declare multiple static tabs in the manifest and subsequently add the app in the channel scope, only the first tab listed in the manifest will be displayed.

Below is an example of an app manifest where a static tab is configured to function across all scopes and contexts within Microsoft Teams:

```json
"staticTabs": [ 
  { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal", 
       "groupChat", 
       "team"
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab",
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
  }
], 
```

If a context is not explicitly defined in the app manifest, Microsoft Teams will default to the following context settings:

```json
"context": [ 
   "personalTab",
   "channelTab",
   "privateChatTab", 
   "meetingChatTab", 
   "meetingDetailsTab", 
   "meetingStage" 
]
```

## Enable personal tab apps for calling extensibility

You have the ability to create personal scope apps that integrate seamlessly with the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and Teams-to-Teams calls. To achieve this, use the appropriate scope and context to build apps that leverage tab type, static scope, personal context, and meeting side panels.

For further details, refer to [build tabs for calling](../../apps-in-teams-meetings/build-tabs-for-calling.md).

## Customizing your static tab in chats or meetings

To tailor your static tab experience within chats, channels, or meetings, you can utilize the `setConfig` APIs in your tab to modify the `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl`. Below is an illustrative example:

```json
pages.config.setConfig({ 
  "contentUrl": "https://wwww.contoso.com/teamsapp/thread/" + context.threadId,
   ...}
```

Only modifications to `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl` are supported for `setConfig`; other properties cannot be altered for static tabs.

## Offline tabs

> [!NOTE]
> Personal tabs with offline functionality are exclusively supported on Teams for Android devices.

You can develop a personal tab that operates in Teams even without an internet connection. An offline tab is particularly advantageous for users working in areas with limited or no network coverage, such as field agents or frontline workers. Users can perform the following tasks in an offline tab:

* Record data using forms that may include images and videos.
* Access details of previously submitted requests, incidents, or forms.

When the user's device reconnects to the internet, the tab automatically synchronizes the locally stored data with an Azure Blob storage. This process ensures that all offline modifications made by the user are updated in a central storage, thereby maintaining data consistency across the organization.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/tab-support-offline-mobile.gif" alt-text="Graphic shows how an offline tab works in Teams mobile client.":::

### Build an offline tab

Before embarking on building an offline tab, ensure that you meet the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) necessary to construct a personal tab.

1. [Create an Azure Blob storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal). Make sure to note down the account and container name for future reference.

2. Clone the [Microsoft Teams Samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/) repository.

3. In the cloned repository, navigate to **samples** > **tab-support-offline** > **nodejs** and open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to open the code sample in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="../../assets/images/tabs/open-tab-sample-vsc.png":::

4. Under **EXPLORER**, go to **server** > **blobStoreOperations.js** and replace `{{ account-Name }}` and `{{ container-Name }}` with your Azure Blob storage account and container's values.

5. Press the **F5** key to debug the app. Teams will open in a browser window once the build is complete.

6. Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account, if prompted.

7. Select **Add** when a dialog box appears, allowing you to add the tab app to Teams.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/add-offline-tab-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add the offline tab app to Teams.":::

Congratulations! You've successfully created a Teams tab with offline functionality.

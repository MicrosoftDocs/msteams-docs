## Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

```cmd
gulp manifest
```

## Build and run your application

### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the `./dist` folder:

```cmd
gulp build

    * `https://localhost:3978/tou`

<details>
<summary><b>Review the source code</b></summary>

### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced * Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc(options => options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
}
```

### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

### Tab.cs

This C# file contains a method that is called from **Tab.cshtml** during configuration.

### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

* A **full color icon** measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
* A **transparent outline icon** measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files need to be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. When a user chooses to add or update your tab, Teams loads the `configurationUrl` specified in your manifest, embeds it in an Iframe, and renders it in your tab.

### .csproj

In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-outline.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\icon-color.png">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
    <EmbeddedResource Include="AppManifest\manifest.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </EmbeddedResource>
  </ItemGroup>
```

</details>

## Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt in the root of your project directory, run the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
ngrok http 3978 --host-header=localhost
```

Ensure that you keep the command prompt with ngrok running and make a note of the URL.

## Update your application

1. Open Visual Studio Solution Explorer and go to the **Pages** > **Shared** folder and open **_Layout.cshtml**, and add the following to the <head> tags section:

    ```html
    <script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://res.cdn.office.net/teams-js/2.2.0/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js" 
      integrity="sha384yBjE++eHeBPzIg+IKl9OHFqMbSdrzY2S/LW3qeitc5vqXewEYRWegByWzBN/chRh" 
      crossorigin="anonymous" >
    </script>
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Do not copy and paste the `<script src="...">` URLs from this page, as they do not represent the latest version. To get the latest version of TeamsJS, always go to [Microsoft Teams JavaScript API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js).

1. Insert a call to `microsoftTeams.app.initialize();` in the `script` tag.

1. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, go to the **Pages** folder and open **Tab.cshtml**

    Within **Tab.cshtml**, the application presents the user with two options for displaying the tab with a red or gray icon. The **Select Gray** or **Select Red** button triggers `saveGray()` or `saveRed()` respectively, sets `pages.config.setValidityState(true)`, and enables **Save** on the configuration page. This code lets Teams know that the requirements configuration is completed and you can proceed with the installation. The parameters of `pages.config.setConfig` are set. Finally, `saveEvent.notifySuccess()` is called to indicate that the content URL is successfully resolved.

1. Update the `websiteUrl` and `contentUrl` values in each function with the HTTPS ngrok URL to your tab.

    Your code should now include the following with **y8rCgT2b** replaced with your ngrok URL:

    ```javascript
        
        let saveGray = () => {
            microsoftTeams.pages.config.registerOnSaveHandler((saveEvent) => {
                microsoftTeams.pages.config.setConfig({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/gray/`,
                    entityId: "grayIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab",
                    removeUrl: ""
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
            });
        }

        let saveRed = () => {
            microsoftTeams.pages.config.registerOnSaveHandler((saveEvent) => {
                microsoftTeams.pages.config.setConfig({
                    websiteUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io`,
                    contentUrl: `https://y8rCgT2b.ngrok.io/red/`,
                    entityId: "redIconTab",
                    suggestedDisplayName: "MyNewTab",
                    removeUrl: ""
                });
                saveEvent.notifySuccess();
            });
        }
    ```

1. Save the updated **Tab.cshtml**.

## Build and run your application

1. In Visual Studio, select **F5** or choose **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu.

1. Verify that **ngrok** is running and working properly by opening your browser and going to your content page via the ngrok HTTPS URL that was provided in your command prompt window.

    > [!TIP]
    > You need to have both your application in Visual Studio and ngrok running to complete the steps provided in this article. If you need to stop running your application in Visual Studio to work on it, **keep ngrok running**. It listens and resumes routing your application's request when it restarts in Visual Studio. If you've to restart the ngrok service it returns a new URL and you've to update your application with the new URL.

<!--- TBD: This note seems to be removed from main. Commenting it for now.
> [!NOTE]
> App Studio can be used to edit your `manifest.json` file and upload the completed package to Teams. You can also manually edit the `manifest.json` file. If you do, ensure that you build the solution again to create the `tab.zip` file to upload.

### Models

**ChannelGroup.cs** presents a message object and methods that can be called from the controllers during configuration.

### Views

The different views in ASP.NET Core MVC are:

* Home: ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** can be displayed as the home page for your application.

* Shared: The partial view markup **_Layout.cshtml** contains the application's overall page structure and shared visual elements that also reference the Teams Library.

### Controllers

The controllers use the `ViewBag` property to transfer values dynamically to the views.

Here's a list of tools you require for building and deploying your app.

| &nbsp;    | Install   | For using... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| &nbsp; | [Visual Studio version 17.2.0 preview 2.1](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=enterprise&ch=pre&rel=17)|  Select Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 Preview (version 17.2.0 preview 2.1). |
| &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and calls - all in one place. |
| &nbsp; | [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |

## Prepare development environment

After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.

### Install Microsoft Teams Toolkit

The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams Store, and more. You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio, or as a Command Line Interface (called `teamsfx`).

# [Latest version of the Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

You can use the latest version of the Visual Studio to develop Teams apps with Blazor Server in .NET.

To install the Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension:

1. Download the latest version of the Visual Studio.
1. Open `vs_enterprise__3bed52501a604464b1eff2ce580fd4eb.exe` from your download folder.
1. Select **Continue** in the **Visual Studio Installer** page to configure your installation.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor/visual-studio-installer.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Installer with continue options highlighted in red.":::

1. Select **ASP.NET and web development** under **Workloads**.

1. Select **Microsoft Teams development tools** under **Installation details**.

1. Select **Install**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor-vs-preview2/vs.install.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Enterprise Preview with the option Asp.NET, web development, and Microsoft Teams development tools under installation details and install highlighted in red.":::

Your Visual Studio is installed in a few minutes.

# [Command line](#tab/cli)

To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

``` bash
npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
```

Depending on your configuration, you might need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

``` bash
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
 ```

This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the remote signed execution policy for PowerShell.

---

## Set up your Teams development tenant

A tenant is like a space or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you upload and test your custom app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

### Enable custom app upload option

After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

Do you already have a tenant, and do you've the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

Verify if you can upload a custom app in Teams:

1. In the Teams client, select **Apps**.
1. Select **Manage your apps**.
1. Select **Upload a custom app**. If you see Upload a custom app option, custom app upload is enabled.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor/upload-custom-app.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > Contact your Teams administrator, if you don't find the option to upload a custom app.

### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it for free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.PNG" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft 365 Developer Program displaying your Microsoft 365 developer subscriptions for the blazor app.":::

1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you've the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

## Get a free Azure account

If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

Now you've got all tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

## Create project workspace for your tab app

## Migrate your configurable tab to static tab

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Migrating your configurable tab to static tab is available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).
> * Migrating your configurable tab to static tab is available only in classic Teams client and isn't available in the [new Teams client](~/resources/teams-updates.md). 
> * To migrate your configurable tab to static tab, use the app manifest v1.16 or later.

Static tab capability is extended to support group chat, channels, and meetings. You can update your existing configurable tab to static tab and add different scopes to the static tab. 

To change your configurable tab to static tab:

1. Move your configuration logic out of your `configurationUrl` code space to your `contentUrl` code space.
1. Add the `staticTabs` property to your [app manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#statictabs) with `scopes` and `context` parameters. Following is an example of app manifest where a static tab is defined that works in all scopes and contexts in Teams:

   ```json
   "staticTabs": [ 
     { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal",  
       "groupChat",
       "team"
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab",
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
     }
   ],
   ```

    For more information, see [configuration page](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md) and [static tab.](~/tabs/how-to/create-personal-tab.md#extend-static-tabs-to-group-chat-channels-and-meetings)

If your app supports [configurable tab,](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md#configuration-page-for-tabs) then you must continue to keep the `configurableTab` property in your app manifest to ensure the backward compatibility of previously pinned tabs. As you can only pin static tabs from now, it's important that previous configurable tabs continue to be supported.

# Get context for your tab

Your tab requires contextual information to display relevant content:

* Basic information about the user, team, or company.
* Locale and theme information.
* The `page.id` and `page.subPageId` that identify what is in this tab (known as `entityId` and `subEntityId` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).

## User context

Context about the user, team, or company can be especially useful when:

* You create or associate resources in your app with the specified user or team.
* You initiate an authentication flow from Microsoft Entra ID or other identity provider, and you don't require the user to enter their username again.

For more information, see [authenticate a user in your Microsoft Teams](~/concepts/authentication/authentication.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although this user information can help provide a smooth user experience, you must not use it as proof of identity.  For example, an attacker can load your page in a browser and render harmful information or requests.

## Access context information

You can access context information in two ways:

* Using [URL placeholder values](#get-context-by-inserting-url-placeholder-values).
* From the Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library [context](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.context) object.

### Get context by inserting URL placeholder values

Use placeholders in your configuration or content URLs. Microsoft Teams replaces the placeholders with the relevant values when determining the actual configuration or content URL. The available placeholders include all fields on the [context](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/microsoftteams.context?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) object. Common placeholders include the following properties:

* [{page.id}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.pageinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-pageinfo-id): The developer-defined unique ID for the page defined when first [configuring the page](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md). (Known as `{entityId}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).
* [{page.subPageId}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.pageinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-pageinfo-subpageid): The developer-defined unique ID for the subpage this content points defined when generating a [deep link](~/concepts/build-and-test/deep-links.md) for a specific item within the page. (Known as `{subEntityId}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).
* [{user.loginHint}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.userinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-userinfo-loginhint): A value suitable as a sign in hint for Microsoft Entra ID. This is usually the sign in name of the current user in their home tenant. (Known as `{loginHint}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).
* [{user.userPrincipalName}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.userinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-userinfo-userprincipalname): The User Principal Name of the current user in the current tenant. (Known as `{userPrincipalName}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).
* [{user.id}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.userinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-userinfo-id): The Microsoft Entra object ID of the current user in the current tenant. (Known as `{userObjectId}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).
* [{app.theme}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.appinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-appinfo-theme): The current user interface (UI) theme such as `default`, `dark`, or `contrast`. (Known as `{theme}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).
* [{team.groupId}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.teaminfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-teaminfo-groupid): The ID of the Microsoft 365 group in which the tab resides. (Known as `{groupId}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0)
* [{user.tenant.id}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.tenantinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-tenantinfo-id): The Microsoft Entra tenant ID of the current user. (Known as `{tid}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).
* [{app.locale}](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app.appinfo#@microsoft-teams-js-app-appinfo-locale): The current locale of the user formatted as *languageId-countryId*, for example `en-us`. (Known as `{locale}` before TeamsJS v2.0.0).

> [!NOTE]
> - The previous `{upn}` placeholder is now deprecated. For backward compatibility, it's a synonym for `{user.loginHint}`.
> - Mobile (Android and iOS) versions of Microsoft Teams support only TeamsJS v1.x.x placeholders.

For example, in your app manifest if you set your tab *configurationUrl* attribute to `"https://www.contoso.com/config?name={user.loginHint}&tenant={user.tenant.id}&group={team.groupId}&theme={app.theme}"` and the signed-in user has the following attributes:

* Their username is **<user@example.com>**.
* Their company tenant ID is **e2653c-etc**.
* They're a member of the Microsoft 365 group with ID **00209384-etc**.
* The user has set their Teams theme to **dark**.

Teams calls the following URL when configuring the tab:

`https://www.contoso.com/config?name=user@example.com&tenant=e2653c-etc&group=00209384-etc&theme=dark`

### Get context by using the Microsoft Teams JavaScript library

You can also retrieve the context information using the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client).

## Retrieve context in private channels

> [!NOTE]
> Private channels are in private developer preview only.

When your content page is loaded in a private channel, the data you receive from the `getContext` call is obfuscated to protect the privacy of the channel.

The following fields are changed when your content page is in a private channel:

* `team.groupId`: Undefined for private channels
* `team.internalId`: Set to the threadId of the private channel
* `team.displayName`: Set to the name of the private channel
* `sharepointSite.url`: Set to the URL of a distinct, unique SharePoint site for the private channel
* `sharepointSite.path`: Set to the path of a distinct, unique SharePoint site for the private channel
* `sharepointSite.domain`: Set to the domain of a distinct, unique SharePoint site domain for the private channel
* `channel.ownerGroupId`: Set to the host team groupId of the private channel

If your page makes use of any of these values, the value of `channel.membershipType` field must be `Private` to determine if your page is loaded in a private channel and can respond appropriately.

> [!NOTE]
>`teamSiteUrl` also works well for standard channels. If your page makes use of any of these values, the value of `channelType` field must be `Shared` to determine if your page is loaded in a shared channel and can respond appropriately.

## Get context in shared channels

When the content UX is loaded in a shared channel, use the data received from `getContext` call for  shared channel changes. If tab makes use of any of the following values, you must populate the `channelType` field to determine if the tab is loaded in a shared channel, and respond appropriately.
For shared channels, the `groupId` value is `null`, since the host team's groupId doesn't accurately reflect the true membership of the shared channel. To address this, the `hostTeamGroupID` and `hostTenantID` properties are newly added and useful for making Microsoft Graph API calls to retrieve membership. `hostTeam` refers to the Team that created the shared channel. `currentTeam` refers to Team that the current user is accessing the shared channel from.

For more information about these concepts and shared channels, see [shared channels](~/concepts/build-and-test/shared-channels.md).

Use the following `getContext` properties in shared channels:

| Property | Description |
|----------|--------------|
|`channelId`| The property is set to the shared channels thread ID.|
|`channelType`| The property is set to `sharedChannel` for shared channels.|
|`groupId`|The property is `null` for shared channels.|
|`hostTenantId`| The property is newly added and describes the host's tenant ID, useful for comparing against the current user's `tid` tenant ID property. |
|`hostTeamGroupId`| The property is newly added and describes the host team’s Microsoft Entra group ID, useful for making Microsoft Graph API calls to retrieve shared channel membership. |
|`teamId`|The property is newly added and set to the thread ID of the current shared team. |
|`teamName`|The property is set to current shared team's `teamName`. |
|`teamType`|The property is set to current shared team's `teamType`.|
|`teamSiteUrl`|The property describes the shared channel's `channelSiteUrl`.|
|`teamSitePath`| The property describes the shared channel's `channelSitePath`.|
|`teamSiteDomain`| The property describes the shared channel's `channelSiteDomain`.|
|`tenantSKU`| The property describes the host team’s `tenantSKU`.|
|`tid`|  The property describes the current user’s tenant ID.|
|`userObjectId`|  The property describes current user’s ID.|
|`userPrincipalName`| The property describes the current user’s UPN.|

For more information on shared channels, see [shared channels](~/concepts/build-and-test/shared-channels.md).

## Handle theme change

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * By default, the [new Teams client](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/27/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-microsoft-teams/) supports light theme for apps in Teams meetings. When the `app.theme` property in getContext API returns the `default` value, Teams client is in light theme.
> * Earlier version of Teams clients only support Dark and Contrast theme for apps in Teams meetings.

You can register your app to be informed if the theme changes by calling `microsoftTeams.app.registerOnThemeChangeHandler(function(theme) { /* ... */ })`.

The `theme` argument in the function is a string with a value of `default`, `dark`, or `contrast`.

# [Default](#tab/default)

The following image shows the default theme option in the Teams:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tabs/light-theme-teams-default.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the default theme in Teams desktop client.":::

# [Dark](#tab/dark)

The following image shows the dark theme option in the Teams:

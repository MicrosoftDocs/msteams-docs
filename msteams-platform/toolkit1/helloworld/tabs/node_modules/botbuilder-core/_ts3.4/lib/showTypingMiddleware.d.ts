 * is received to let them know that the bot has received the message and is working on the response.
 * You can specify a delay in milliseconds before the first typing activity is sent and then a frequency,
 * also in milliseconds which determines how often another typing activity is sent. Typing activities
 * will continue to be sent until your bot sends another message back to the user

    Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C#, instead of JavaScript. 
    
    You can create a tab app and a bot app with Blazor and the latest version of Visual Studio.

    Here's a list of tools you require for building and deploying your app.

    | &nbsp;    | Install   | For using... |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio version 17.2.0 preview 2.1](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=enterprise&ch=pre&rel=17)|  Select Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 Preview (version 17.2.0 preview 2.1). |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings and calls - all in one place. |
    | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
    
    ## Prepare development environment

    After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.

    ### Install Microsoft Teams Toolkit

    The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio, or as a Command Line Interface (called `teamsfx`). 
    
    # [Latest version of the Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

    You can use the latest version of the Visual Studio to develop Teams apps with Blazor Server in .NET.

    To install the Microsoft Teams Toolkit extension:

    1. Download the latest version of the Visual Studio.
    1. Open `vs_enterprise__3bed52501a604464b1eff2ce580fd4eb.exe` from your download folder.
    1. Select **Continue** in the **Visual Studio Installer** page to configure your installation.

       :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor/visual-studio-installer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Installer with Continue option highlighted in red.":::  

    1. Select **ASP.NET and web development** under **Workloads**.

    1. Select **Microsoft Teams development tools** under **Installation details**.
       
    1. Select **Install**.

       :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor-vs-preview2/vs.install.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Enterprise Preview with the option Asp.NET and web development, Microsoft Teams development tools under installation details and install highlighted in red." lightbox="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/blazor-vs-preview2/vs.install.png":::  
       
     Your Visual Studio is installed in a few minutes.
    
    # [Command line](#tab/cli)

    To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

    ``` bash
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

    ``` bash
    sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

    Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

    You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the remote signed execution policy for PowerShell.

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A tenant is like a space or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Enable sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
      
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload a custom app**. If you see Upload a customized app option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Manage your apps in Teams with the Upload an app dialog open. Apps icon, Manage your apps, Upload an app, and Upload a customised app options are highlighted in red.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, connect to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it for free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Microsoft 365 Developer Program displaying your Microsoft 365 developer subscriptions.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

    Now you've got all tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

    | App icons | The app icons are stored as PNG files in `color.png` and `outline.png`. |
    | `manifest.json` | The app manifest for publishing through the Developer Portal for Teams is stored in `Properties/manifest.json`. |
    | `BackendController.cs` | A backend controller is provided in `Controllers/BackendController.cs` for assisting with authentication. |

    ## Take a tour of the source code for Teams bot app

    After project creation, you have the components to build a basic personal app. You can view the project directory structure in the **Solution Explorer** area of the latest Visual Studio.

    Teams Toolkit creates a scaffolding for your project based on the capabilities you selected. Among other files, Teams Toolkit maintains:

    | Folder name | Contents |
    | --- | --- |
    | App icons | The app icons are stored as PNG files in `color.png` and `outline.png`. |
    | `manifest.json` | The app manifest for publishing through the Developer Portal for Teams is stored in `Properties/manifest.json`. |
    | `BackendController.cs` | A backend controller is provided in `Controllers/BackendController.cs` for assisting with authentication. |
    | `TeamsFx.cs` and `JS/src/index.js` | The content is used for initializing communications with the Teams host. |
    
    You can add backend functionality by adding other ASP.NET Core controllers to your application.

    To build and run your app locally:

    1.  Use ngrok or Command prompt to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

        ```bash
        ngrok http --host-header=localhost 5130
        ```
    
    1. Select **Project** > **Teams Toolkit** > **Prepare Teams App Dependencies**.

        1. Registers your application for sideloading in Teams.
        1. Starts your application backend running locally.
        1. Starts your application front-end hosted locally.
        1. Starts Teams in a web browser with a command to instruct Teams to side load the application (the URL is registered inside the application manifest).

        > When you run the app for the first time, all dependencies are downloaded, and the app is built. A browser window automatically opens when the build is complete. This process can take 3-5 minutes to complete.

        Your web browser starts to run the app.

    1. Select **Add** when prompted to sideload the app onto Teams on your local machine.

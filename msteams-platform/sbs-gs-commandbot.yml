    Microsoft Teams allows you to automate repetitive tasks using a command bot. It responds to simple commands sent in chats with Adaptive Cards. 

    In this tutorial, you learn:

    - How to build command bot with Teams Toolkit.
    - About the directory structure of your app.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to build command bot with Teams Toolkit. You can see the following output:

   > [!NOTE]
   > The guide is tested on Teams Toolkit v5 and Nodejs version 14 and 16. The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that hasn't been tested.

   ## Prepare development environment

   After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.


   ### Install the Teams Toolkit

   The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
   You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code or CLI (command-line interface) called `TeamsFx`.


   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

   1. Open Visual Studio Code and select **Extensions** (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
   1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
   1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/teams-toolkit.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams Toolkit extension installation.":::

    The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar** after it's installed.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar.":::

   You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

    > [!NOTE]
    > The latest version of Teams Toolkit is v5.

   # [Command line](#tab/cli)

   To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

   ``` bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

   ``` bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
   ```

   It's more common on Linux and macOS systems.

   Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

   You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Before you run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, ensure you enable the **remote signed** execution policy for PowerShell.

   ## Set up your Teams development tenant

   A **tenant** is like a space, or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also sideload and test your app.

   ### Check for sideloading option

   After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This is known as sideloading. Sign-in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable Sideloading to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

   Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

   To verify sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** .
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Publish an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > Contact Teams administrator, if you don't have the option to upload a custom app.

   ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

   If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
   1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
   1. Select **Set up E5 subscription** from the welcome screen.
   1. Set up administrator account. After you finish, the following screen displays.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 Developer Program of the administrator account.":::

   1. Sign-in to Teams using the new administrator account. Now you should have the **Upload a custom app** option.

    Teams Toolkit provides components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the **Explorer** area of Visual Studio Code.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/sbs-command-bot/folder-structure-command-bot.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the structure tab":::

    If you choose to use UI framework, following sample template code provides a scaffolding with React components. It contains following content:

    | Folder / File | Contents |
    | - | - |
    | `teamsapp.yml` | Main project file describes your application configuration and defines the set of actions to run in each lifecycle stages. |
    | `teamsapp.local.yml`| This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging. |
    | `env/`| Name / value pairs are stored in environment files and used by `teamsapp.yml` to customize the provisioning and deployment rules. |
    | `.vscode/` | VSCode files for debugging. |
    | `appPackage/` | Templates for the Teams application manifest. |
    | `infra/` | Templates for provisioning Azure resources. |
    | `src/` | The source code for the application. |
    | `src/index.js` | Application entry point and `restify` handlers for command and response. |

- title: Deploy your first Teams app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You've learnt to build, and run Teams app with command bot capability. The final step is to deploy your app on Azure.

    Let's deploy the first app with command bot capability on Azure using Teams Toolkit.

    ## Sign in to your Azure account

    Use your account to access the Microsoft Azure portal and to provide provision new cloud resources to support your app.

    1. Open Visual Studio Code.
    1. Open the project folder that you created the command bot app.
    1. Select the Teams Toolkit  :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the sidebar.
    1. Select **Sign-in to Azure**.

        > [!TIP]
        > If you have the Azure Account extension installed and are using the same account, you can skip this step.

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign-in to the account.
    1. Sign-in to your Azure account using your credentials.
    1. Close the browser when prompted and return to Visual Studio Code.

        The **ACCOUNTS** section of the sidebar shows the two accounts separately. It also lists the number of usable Azure subscriptions available to you.
        
        > [!NOTE]
        > Ensure you have at least one usable Azure subscription available.

        Now you're ready to deploy your app to Azure!

    ## Deploy your app to Azure

     Under **DEPLOYMENT** you can provision for necessary cloud resources and your app's code is copied into the created cloud resources.

    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

    1. Select the Teams Toolkit :::image type="icon" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the Visual Studio Code sidebar.

# Agents in Teams

With the introduction of Teams AI library, developers can create agents tailored for Teams. Agents in Teams interact through natural language, connect to business data, and perform actions on behalf of users. Your agents built for Teams can also be extended beyond Teams into other Microsoft 365 hubs, such as Outlook, using Microsoft 365 Agents SDK.

## What are agents in Teams?

Agents in Teams are intelligent apps built with the Teams AI library. They interact through natural language (LLM), connect to business data, and perform actions on behalf of users. Leveraging large language models and Microsoft’s ecosystem, these agents deliver secure, customized AI experiences within Teams and can be extended to other Microsoft 365 hubs using the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK.

 An agent in Teams understands user intent, performs tasks, and enhances collaboration.

## Why build agents for Teams?

Building agents for Teams helps to enhance collaboration and increase productivity. Agents can automate workflows, provide real-time updates, and facilitate informed decision-making. By leveraging Teams' capabilities, organizations can streamline processes, increase team efficiency, and improve customer engagement. Within Teams, agents can focus on high-priority work to enable better outcomes and success.

### Agent user experience

- **In-context intelligence**: Users can interact directly with agents within their Teams usage during conversations and meetings.
- **Task automation**: Agents can handle repetitive or complex tasks, such as summarizing chats, scheduling meetings, or pulling business data.
- **Personalized assistance**: Agents can adapt to user preferences and roles for more relevant and actionable insights.

### Agent developer experience

- **Native Teams integration**: Simplified development using Teams AI library with built-in support for Teams' authentication, messaging, and UI components.
- **Security and compliance**: Benefit from identity, compliance, and data protection frameworks.
- **Extensibility across Microsoft 365**: Agents can evolve beyond Teams into other Microsoft 365 experiences using Microsoft 365 Agents SDK.

### Common user scenarios

Here are some scenarios for agents in Teams:

- Helpdesk and customer support
- Task automation

## How to choose?

Developers and organizations can choose from multiple approaches depending on the app requirements:

- **Low-code or no-code**: Use Microsoft Copilot Studio to design conversational experiences with minimal code.
- **Pro-code**: Use Teams AI library to build fully customized agents, integrated with agents to handle complex or domain-specific needs.

## Tools and SDKs for building agents

Here's a list of tools and SDKs you can use to build agents for Teams:

- **Teams AI library**: This is the latest SDK for building agents specifically tailored for the Teams environment It simplifies the development process by providing:

  - Simplified message handling
  - Integration with Adaptive Cards and Teams UI components
  - Native support for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI models

- **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK**: The Microsoft 365 Agents SDK allows developers to extend their Teams agents and apps beyond Teams. It helps make the agents and apps available for Microsoft 365 Chat,  Outlook, and other Microsoft 365 hubs. This enables developers to deliver consistent experience across platforms in the Microsoft ecosystem.

- **Microsoft 365 Agent Toolkit**: Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit is the pro-code option for building and debugging agents and actions (plugins). You can use the toolkit to build agents tailored for Teams. It also provides support for all major Microsoft 365 platform extensibility surfaces, including agents, tabs, bots, message extensions, and Outlook Add-ins. Agents Toolkit is available as an extension for Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.

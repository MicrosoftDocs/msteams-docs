# Why build agents on Microsoft Teams?  

[Opening paragraph – ≤ 80 words explaining that Teams is the primary conversational canvas inside Microsoft 365 and the native home for custom Copilot skills.]

## Business advantages  

- Reach 400 M+ monthly active users without switching apps.  
- Reduce deployment friction with tenant-wide admin controls and instant per-user install.  
- Monetize through Teams Store subscriptions and in-product purchase APIs.  
- Built-in compliance, data residency, and audit logging meet enterprise requirements.

## User-experience advantages  

- Seamless single sign-on with Microsoft 365 identity.  
- One skill, many canvases—chat, meetings, Outlook, Microsoft 365 hub.  
- Unified notifications in the Teams activity feed.  
- Mobile, desktop, and web clients share the same agent runtime.

## Developer advantages  

| Capability | Benefit |  
|------------|---------|  
| Agents Toolkit | Scaffold, tunnel, and debug in one click. |  
| Teams AI Library | Handle intent recognition, memory, and function calls with minimal code. |  
| Cross-host manifest | Surface in Outlook & M365 without rewriting. |  
| Microsoft Graph | Tap into calendar, chat, files, and presence with a single SDK. |  
| Azure integration | Add OpenAI, Functions, and Fluid real-time data with first-class auth. |

## Copilot integration flow

## Comparison with other delivery models  

| Approach | Time-to-value | Scale | AI readiness | IT admin control |  
|----------|---------------|-------|--------------|------------------|  
| Stand-alone bot | Medium | Limited to chat URL | DIY | Decentralized |  
| Classic Teams app | Fast | Teams only | Manual | Centralized |  
| **Teams agent (recommended)** | **Fastest** | Teams + Outlook + M365 | Built-in to Copilot | Policy-driven |

## Success snapshots  

1. **Contoso Support Agent** cut ticket resolution time by 30 % by surfacing knowledge base answers in Copilot.  
2. **Fabrikam Deal Coach** increased seller win-rate 15 % by embedding CRM insights into Teams calls.

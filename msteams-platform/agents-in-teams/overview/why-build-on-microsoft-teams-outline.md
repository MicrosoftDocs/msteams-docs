# Why build on Microsoft Teams?  

[Template instruction → Open with a concise paragraph (≤ 80 words) describing Teams’ reach—400 M+ monthly active users, deep Microsoft 365 integration, and the new agent runtime that lets you add intelligence into everyday collaboration.]

## Business value  

[Template instruction → Write each bullet as a crisp benefit + outcome.]  

- Accelerate ROI: deploy once to Teams and surface in Outlook & Microsoft 365 without extra engineering.  
- Boost workforce productivity: AI agents reduce context-switching by bringing data and actions into the flow of work.  
- Trust & security: leverage Microsoft compliance, data residency, and admin-controlled permissions.  
- Marketplace monetization: reach millions of organizations through the Teams Store with subscription and in-app purchase options.

## User value  

[Template instruction → 3–4 bullets focused on end-user experience.]  

- Friction-free sign-in with Microsoft 365 credentials and single sign-on.  
- Multi-modal interactions—chat, voice, meetings, cards—choose what fits the moment.  
- Unified activity feed & notifications so important updates never get lost.  
- Seamless mobility: desktop, web, Android, and iOS clients share the same app fabric.

## Developer value  

[Template instruction → Emphasize tooling and lowered barriers.]  

- Agents Toolkit: templates, local tunnels, and one-click debug streamline setup.  
- Reusable skills: one manifest powers bots, message extensions, tabs, and Copilot plug-ins.  
- Open standards: REST, Adaptive Cards, JavaScript/TypeScript, .NET, Python.  
- Extensible with Azure services (OpenAI, Functions, Storage, Cognitive Search) and Microsoft Graph APIs.

## Comparison with alternative approaches  

| Approach | Coverage | AI-readiness | Admin control | Time-to-value |  
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------|  
| Stand-alone web app | Limited | DIY | Custom | High |  
| Teams native app (classic) | Teams only | Manual | Central | Medium |  
| AI-powered agent on Teams *(recommended)* | Teams + Outlook + Microsoft 365 | Built-in orchestration, Copilot surface | Admin policies & consent | **Fastest** |

[Template instruction → Fill cells with one-word qualifiers (“High / Medium / Low”) or short phrases.]

## Success stories  

[Template instruction → List 2–3 real or hypothetical case studies in one sentence each.]

## Limitations & considerations  

[Template instruction → Call out licensing or governance prerequisites in ≤ 2 sentences.]

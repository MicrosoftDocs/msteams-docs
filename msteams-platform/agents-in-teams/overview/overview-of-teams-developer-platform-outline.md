# Overview of the Microsoft Teams developer platform  

[template instruction → In 3-4 sentences (< 100 words) explain that Teams is now an AI-first collaboration canvas, list the primary extensibility points (agents, classic apps, cross-M365 surfaces), and set the expectation that readers will dive deeper in subsequent articles.]

## Why build on Teams  

[template instruction → Provide 2-3 bullet points on business value: pervasive reach, built-in identity & compliance, new AI-agent runtime, one code-base across Microsoft 365.]

## Core extensibility pillars  

[template instruction → Introduce each item with a one-line description.]  

- AI-powered agents (Copilot plug-ins, custom engine agents)  
- Conversational bots & message extensions  
- Collaborative UI surfaces (tabs, stageview, Adaptive Cards)  
- Meeting & calling apps  
- Notifications, webhooks, device capabilities  
- Cross-platform hosting (Teams, Outlook, Microsoft 365)

## Architecture at a glance  

[template instruction → Include a simple Mermaid or ASCII diagram placeholder plus 3-5 numbered callouts showing user ⇄ Teams ⇄ your service, highlighting where Agents SDK / Graph / Azure services plug in.]

## Development lifecycle  

1. Plan & design  
2. Build with Agents Toolkit & SDKs  
3. Test & debug locally or in the cloud  
4. Publish to the Teams Store or your org tenant  
5. Grow adoption & monitor analytics  
[template instruction → Add a one-sentence explanation under each step.]

## Limitations  

[template instruction → Note current preview limits for agents—keep to ≤ 2 sentences.]

## Next step  

See “[What are AI-powered agents?](../get-started/what-are-agents.md)” to learn how agents transform the developer story.

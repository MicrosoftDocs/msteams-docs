# Agent Reactions in Teams

Use agents to communicate not only through text but also using reactions, emojis, and context-aware actions. It signals agent's intentional design to improve user trust and make agent behavior more transparent and shows how the agent understands user intent and need.

Map emojis and reactions to specific actions thar the agent can take in response to ongoing conversation.

You can develop agents for Teams using the `addReaction` and `removeReaction` methods to send reactions to messages in a chat.

    Microsoft Teams conversation bot allows users to interact with your web service through text, interactive cards, and dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x). Basic conversations are handled through the Bot Framework connector, a single REST API. This API enables your bot to communicate with Teams and other channels. 
    
    **Key features of Bot Builder SDK**

    * Provides access to the Bot Framework connector.
    * Manages conversation flow and state.
    * Incorporates cognitive services, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP).

    When your bot is added to a group or a team, an introduction message is sent. The message provides a brief description of the bot's features and how to use them.
 
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a conversation bot in the Teams application. You can see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

    | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |   
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments.  If you haven't installed the latest version, install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call all in one place |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`).|

      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    Register your bot with Azure Bot service when you develop and host it in Azure. Following are the steps:

    * Register your bot with Azure Bot service.
    * Create client secret that enables single sign-on (SSO) authentication of the bot.
    * Add Teams channel to deploy the bot.
    * Create a tunnel to your web server's endpoints using dev tunnel (recommended) or ngrok.
    * Add messaging endpoint to dev tunnel you created.

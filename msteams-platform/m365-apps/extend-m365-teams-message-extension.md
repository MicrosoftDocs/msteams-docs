# Extend a Teams message extension across Microsoft 365

Message extensions allow users to interact with your web service using buttons and forms. Users can search or initiate actions in an external system from Microsoft Teams and Outlook by extending your Teams apps across Microsoft 365. There are two types of message extensions:

* Search-based message extensions: Allow users to search an external system and share results through the compose message area of the client.

* Action-based message extensions: Allow users with a modal pop-up to collect or display information, process the interaction, and send the information back to the client as a rich card.

> [!NOTE]
> Teams search-based message extensions are generally available for Outlook and action-based message extensions are available in preview for Outlook.

Outlook mobile users on Android and iOS can receive and take actions on cards from your apps that were sent to them by users on Outlook on the web and Outlook for Windows.

Teams message extension across Microsoft 365 also supports [link unfurling](../messaging-extensions/how-to/link-unfurling.md) that display cards to launch [Stageview](../tabs/tabs-link-unfurling.md) and task modules.

## Prerequisites

To extend your Teams message extension to Outlook, ensure the following:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Check for message extensions support within Outlook for Windows desktop, web, and mobile, see the support table in [extend Teams apps across Microsoft 365](~/m365-apps/overview.md).
> * [A Microsoft 365 Developer Program sandbox tenant.](~/m365-apps/prerequisites.md#prepare-a-developer-tenant-for-testing) For action based message extension, enroll your developer tenant for Microsoft 365 [Targeted Releases](~/m365-apps/prerequisites.md#enroll-your-developer-tenant-for-microsoft-365-targeted-releases-optional).
> * [A test environment with Microsoft 365 apps installed from the Microsoft 365 Apps **Current Channel**.](~/m365-apps/prerequisites.md#enroll-your-developer-tenant-for-microsoft-365-targeted-releases-optional)
> * [(Optional) Microsoft Visual Studio Code with the Teams Toolkit extension.](~/m365-apps/prerequisites.md#enroll-your-developer-tenant-for-microsoft-365-targeted-releases-optional)

To extend your Teams message extension to Outlook, you can either build a new message extension app with Teams Toolkit or extend an existing Teams message extension app to Outlook.

# [Build a message extension app for Outlook](#tab/ttk)

You can build a Teams message extension app for Outlook through Teams Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code. To build a message extension app for Outlook, ensure the following:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * [Upload your app in Teams](#upload-your-custom-app-in-teams)
> * [Preview your message extension in Outlook](#preview-your-message-extension-in-outlook)

You can build either a search-based or an action-based message extension.

[!INCLUDE [message-extensions-outlook](../includes/messaging-extensions/message-extensions-outlook.md)]

Now, you can [upload your app in Teams](#upload-your-custom-app-in-teams) and [preview your message extension in Outlook](#preview-your-message-extension-in-outlook). To build your app package through Teams Toolkit, see [build app package.](~/toolkit/publish.md#build-app-package)

# [Extend an existing Teams message extension app to Outlook](#tab/existing-app)

To extend your existing Teams message extension app to Outlook, ensure the following:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * [Update your app manifest.](#update-your-app-manifest)
> * [Add the Microsoft 365 channel for your app.](#add-microsoft-365-channel-for-your-app)
> * [Update Microsoft Entra app registration for SSO.](#update-microsoft-entra-app-registration-for-sso)
> * [Upload your updated app in Teams.](#upload-your-custom-app-in-teams)
> * [Preview your message extension in Outlook](#preview-your-message-extension-in-outlook)

### Update your app manifest

Update the [app manifest](../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md) (previously called Teams app manifest) schema version `1.13` or later to enable your Teams message extension to run in Outlook.

Open your app manifest and update the `$schema` and `manifestVersion` with the following values:

```json
{
"$schema" : "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.16/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
"manifestVersion" : "1.16"
}
```

### Add Microsoft 365 channel for your app

In Microsoft Teams, a message extension consists of a web service that you host and an app manifest, which defines where your web service is hosted. The web service takes the advantage of [Bot Framework SDK](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview) messaging schema and secure communication protocol through a Teams channel registered for your bot.

For users to interact with your message extension from Outlook, you need to enable the **Microsoft 365** channel for your Azure bot resource of the message extension app.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you've previously enabled the **Outlook** channel for your bot, you'll need to enable the **Microsoft 365** channel for your message extension to function correctly in Microsoft Outlook. The Outlook channel is no longer used for message extensions running in Outlook and can be disabled.

1. Go to [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or [Bot Framework portal](https://dev.botframework.com) (if you've previously registered there), go to your bot resource.

1. From **Settings** > **Channels**.

1. Under **Available channels**, select **Microsoft 365** channel.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/azure-bot-channel-message-extensions.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 Extensions Preview channel for your bot from the Azure Bot Channels pane.":::

1. Select **Apply**.

   :::image type="content" source="../assets/images/azure-bot-channel-message-extensions-apply.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 Message Extensions channel for your bot from the Azure Bot Channels pane.":::

1. Confirm that your **Microsoft 365** channel is listed along with **Microsoft Teams** in your bot's **Channels** pane.

### Update Microsoft Entra app registration for SSO

> [!NOTE]
> You can skip this step if you're building an app for Outlook using Teams Toolkit, as the scenario doesn't involve Microsoft Entra single sign-on authentication.

Microsoft Entra single sign-on (SSO) for message extensions works the same way in Outlook [as it does in Teams](/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/authentication/auth-aad-sso-bots). However, you need to add several client application identifiers to the Microsoft Entra app registration of your bot in your tenant's **App registrations** portal.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your sandbox tenant account.
1. Select **App registrations**.
1. Select the name of your application to open its app registration.
1. Select **Manage** > **Expose an API**.
1. In the **Authorized client applications** section, ensure all the following `Client Id` values are listed:

   |Microsoft 365 client application | Client ID |
   |--|--|
   |Teams desktop and mobile |1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 |
   |Teams web |5e3ce6c0-2b1f-4285-8d4b-75ee78787346 |
   |Microsoft 365 web | 4765445b-32c6-49b0-83e6-1d93765276ca |
   |Microsoft 365 desktop | 0ec893e0-5785-4de6-99da-4ed124e5296c |
   |Microsoft 365 mobile | d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c |
   |Outlook desktop | d3590ed6-52b3-4102-aeff-aad2292ab01c |
   |Outlook Web Access | bc59ab01-8403-45c6-8796-ac3ef710b3e3 |
   |Outlook mobile | 27922004-5251-4030-b22d-91ecd9a37ea4 |

### Upload your custom app in Teams

Upload your updated message extension ([app package](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package)) into Teams. After you complete, message extension appears in your installed **Apps** from the compose message area.

1. Create a .zip file with app manifest and app [icons](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#icons).

1. Go to **Microsoft Teams** and sign in using your sandbox tenant account.

1. Select **Apps** > **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**.

   :::image type="content" source="images/teams-manage-your-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Upload an app option under Manage your apps.":::

1. Select the **Upload a custom app** option, select your .zip file, and install (**Add**) it to your Teams client.

   :::image type="content" source="images/teams-upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Upload a custom app option in Teams.":::

After it's uploaded through Teams, your message extension is available in Outlook for Windows desktop and web.

### Preview your message extension in Outlook

Here's how to test your message extension running in Outlook on the web. To preview your app running in Outlook on the web, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to [outlook.com](https://www.outlook.com) using your test tenant credentials.
1. Select **New message**.
1. Select **Apps** on the ribbon.

   :::image type="content" source="images/outlook-me.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the preview your message extension in Outlook on the web.":::

Your message extension is listed. You can invoke it from there and use it just as you would while composing a message in Teams.

## Debugging

As you debug your message extension, you can identify the source (originating from Teams versus Outlook) of bot requests by the [channelId](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/main/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-activity.md#channel-id) field of the [Activity](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/main/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-activity.md) object. When a user performs a query, your service receives a standard Bot Framework `Activity` object. One of the properties in the Activity object is `channelId`, which has the value of `msteams` or `m365extensions`, depending on where the bot request originates. For more information, see [search based message extensions SDK](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/messaging-extension-v3/search-extensions) and [action based messaging extensions SDK](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/messaging-extension-v3/create-extensions).

## Limitations

While your updated message extension continues to run in Teams, you must be aware of the following limitations:

* Message extensions in Outlook are supported only in the [`compose`](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#composeextensions) context. In Teams app manifest, message extension contexts such as `commandBox` and `message` aren't supported in Outlook.

* Action-based message extensions that [send cards](../messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/respond-to-task-module-submit.md#respond-with-a-card-inserted-into-the-compose-message-area) into the compose box are supported in Outlook. However, using [bots to deliver cards](../messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/respond-to-task-module-submit.md#) isn't supported. In this scenario, you can convert your message extension to [send cards](../messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/respond-to-task-module-submit.md#respond-with-a-card-inserted-into-the-compose-message-area) into the compose box in Outlook.

* You can't insert more than five [Adaptive Cards](/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/design-effective-cards?tabs=design) in an email.

* [Card actions](/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-actions?tabs=json) of type `messageBack`, `imBack`, `invoke`, and `signin` aren't supported. `openURL` is the only supported card action.

* Adaptive Card actions are supported. For `Action.Submit` only [stageview](../tabs/tabs-link-unfurling.md#invoke-collaborative-stageview-from-adaptive-card) and [taskmodule](../task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/task-modules-bots.md#bot-framework-card-actions-vs-adaptive-card-actionsubmit-actions) launching is supported.

> [!NOTE]
> When you test an app with link unfurling, ensure that you remove the app manually after testing. If multiple apps are monitoring the same domain, the app installed most recently might not be invoked to unfurl the link in Outlook, as it would in Teams.

Use the [Microsoft Teams developer community channels](/microsoftteams/platform/feedback) to report issues and provide feedback.

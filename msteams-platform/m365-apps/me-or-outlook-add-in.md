# Scenarios for creating an Outlook add-in and a message extension

An Outlook add-in and a message extension allow you to create rich and interactive content for email messages and meeting invitations. You can create an Outlook add-in and a message extension for your Teams app based on the scenario.

If your app includes scenarios from Outlook add-in and message extension, then you must create both apps, an Outlook add-in and a message extension. You must host both these apps at the same domain so that they can share files.

## Guidelines for Outlook add-in and message extension

# [**Outlook add-in**](#tab/outlook-add-in)

Create an Outlook add-in if your app requires any of the following scenarios:

* Access to the properties of email messages or calendar items.
* Ability to respond automatically to changes in the properties of email messages or calendar items.
* Access to the content of email messages and calendar items with fine-grained read or write access that is provided by [Outlook add-in APIs](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/apis).
* Read or write access to the user's mailbox using the [Outlook add-in APIs](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/apis).
* Ability to start up automatically in response to events without explicit user action. For more information, see [Event-based activation](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/autolaunch).
* Ability to manipulate Outlook-specific settings, such as [custom properties](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/metadata-for-an-outlook-add-in) and [internet headers](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/internet-headers).
* Ability to run within messages and calendar items in [shared mailboxes or shared folders](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/delegate-access).

# [**Message extension**](#tab/messaging-extension)

Create a message extension if your app requires any of the following scenarios:

* Ability to work in both Teams chat and Teams calendar items, as well as Outlook email messages and calendar items.
* Ability to use [Adaptive Cards](../task-modules-and-cards/cards/design-effective-cards.md) as the canvas for the inserted content.
* Ability to use [link unfurling](../messaging-extensions/how-to/link-unfurling.md), that is, to insert a rich preview of a link.

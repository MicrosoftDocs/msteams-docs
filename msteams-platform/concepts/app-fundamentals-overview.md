# Microsoft Teams app development fundamentals

Microsoft Teams app fundamentals give the direction you need to create your custom Teams app. You can recognize the framework required to plan your Teams app. The document helps you to understand the user-app communication and figure out the kind of app surfaces you need to use or the APIs your app might require in the process.

You can experiment with the extension points for building your apps. Important app project components help you to correctly configure your app page. Teams app can have [multiple capabilities](../concepts/capabilities-overview.md) and [entry points](../concepts/extensibility-points.md).

## Understand your use cases

You can recognize user issues and identify the answers to some common problems the users face. You can build your Teams app by finding the right combination to meet your user's needs.

Some common questions answered are as follows:

* Do you need authentication?
* What problem is your app going to solve?
* Who are the end-users of the app?
* How should the onboarding experience be and what else the app can do?

## Map your use cases to Teams app capabilities

[Map your use cases](../concepts/design/map-use-cases.md) covers some common scenarios and how to choose your app's capabilities. Information to share your app and collaborate on items in an external system is provided. You can also learn how to initiate workflows and send notifications to users.

# Plan your app with Teams features

Building an awesome Teams app starts with identifying the right combination of features to meet your users' needs. Every design choice—from features to capabilities—stems from this underlying purpose.

Microsoft Teams isn’t just a collaboration platform; it’s also a social, natively cross-platform solution deeply integrated with Microsoft 365. It offers a personal canvas to create robust apps that empower users across devices.

In this document, you will learn how to:

• Identify and map use cases to Teams features.  
• Use a planning checklist.  
• Plan beyond app deployment.

## Plan with Teams

Microsoft Teams provides a comprehensive suite of toolkits, libraries, and sample apps that support every stage of app development. The app building lifecycle is broken down into several key phases:

Below is an overview of the phases:

1. [Before you build](#before-you-build)  
2. [During build](#during-build)  
3. [Post-build](#post-build)  
4. [Planning checklist](../concepts/design/planning-checklist.md)

Each phase is designed to guide you through the process, ensuring that every aspect of your Teams app—from initial concept to deployment—is thoroughly planned and executed.

## Before you build

Before you start development, it’s essential to deeply understand your user and their challenges. Use these key steps to structure your approach:

1. **Understand your use case and Teams app features**  
   - Identify your user’s requirements.  
   - Determine which Teams features best address these needs.

2. **Map your use cases**  
   - Establish clear mappings between common use cases and Teams capabilities, such as sharing, collaboration, workflows, and integration with social platforms.

3. **Plan analytics for your Teams app**  
   - Outline how you will track and analyze both aggregate and user-specific data.  
   - Use these insights to address issues, optimize the user journey, and plan enhancements to your app.

4. **Plan responsive tabs for Teams mobile**  
   - Consider common usage scenarios on mobile devices.  
   - Ensure the design accommodates responsive layouts for a smooth mobile experience.

*Real-World Example*: When designing an app for remote project collaboration, map features like chat, file sharing, and meeting scheduling to improve team efficiency.

## During build

The development phase provides a hands-on opportunity to bring your planned features to life. The following steps outline best practices to ensure a robust build process:

1. **Create and build the app project**  
   - Select the development environment that suits your app’s requirements.  
   - Leverage the Teams Toolkit or other SDKs (such as C#, Blazor, or Node.js) to kick-start your project.

2. **Design your app UI**  
   - Utilize the Teams UI Toolkit in tandem with Fluent UI React components to create a coherent and engaging layout.
   - Focus on consistency and ease of use to improve user engagement.

3. **Use Teams as a platform**  
   - Develop your app as either a single- or multi-capability solution.
   - Tap into the integrated products and services (Azure, Microsoft Graph, SharePoint, Power Apps) that enrich the user experience.

    Your app can leverage various Teams capabilities, including:
    - Tabs
    - Bots
    - Messaging Extensions
    - Connectors and Webhooks  
      
    Each capability is enhanced by backend services that automate tasks and streamline processes.  
      
    *Practical Use Case*: Use Teams integration to combine multiple data sources, such as CRM data and task management, into a single, unified user interface to streamline business operations.

4. **Integrate device capabilities**  
   - Enhance your app by incorporating native device features like cameras, QR or barcode scanners, photo galleries, microphones, and geolocation.
   - This integration enriches the user experience, especially in mobile scenarios.

5. **Instrument code for analytics**  
   - Embed analytics markers (instrumentation markers) in critical sections of your code.
   - Use these markers to track both aggregate data and individual user interactions, ensuring you can monitor performance and user behavior effectively.

*Real-World Example*: While building a field service application, integrating device capabilities such as the camera and QR code scanner can facilitate real-time data capture during on-site visits.

## Post-build

Once development is complete, focus on integrating and managing your app:

1. **Integrate your app with Teams and other Microsoft services**  
   - Connect your app seamlessly with Microsoft 365, Microsoft Graph, and other essential services to maximize functionality.

2. **Use the Developer Portal**  
   - Configure, manage, and deploy your app via the Developer Portal.
   - This centralized management minimizes deployment complexities and provides a consistent experience.

*Practical Scenario*: After developing a new communication tool, using the Developer Portal ensures consistent updates and management across your organization’s Teams environment.

## Plan for government and sovereign clouds

If you plan to deploy your Teams app within government cloud platforms, it is crucial to:

- Understand the specific capabilities and limitations of each government tenant.
- Plan for the unique requirements related to purchase and deployment in these environments.

For further details on extending your Teams app to government cloud platforms, refer to the following guides:  
• Plan for [government clouds](cloud-overview.md)  
• Plan for [sovereign cloud](sovereign-cloud.md)

*Real-World Scenario*: Deploying a secure workflow management system for public sector employees will involve careful planning to ensure compliance with government cloud standards and regulations.

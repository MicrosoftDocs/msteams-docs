# Gain traction for your collaborative app in the market

In the Traction stage, you’ll want to gain mindshare for your collaborative app among top customers. You will build readiness to scale adoption and growth, and start realizing return on investment. Here are the various initiatives and growth levers at your disposal:

## What should you do during the Traction stage?

<br>
<details>
<summary>Plan, build readiness and drive adoption among customers</summary>

As soon as  your colalborative app is published and customers are made aware of its existence, the entire focus of your organization must shift towards driving adoption of your app among existing customers first. Follow the step-by-step guidance, resources and best practices available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/promote-app-adoption) to plan and support the rollout of your Teams app in your customers’ organizations, navigate business decision makers, IT admins and educate end-users. The outcome of a successful app rollout among your existing customers is a pre-requisite to learn from user feedback, achieve product-market fit, acquire net new customers, monetize your app and  eventually derive RoI out of your build and go-to-market investments.

<summary>Upskill customer success team on your new Teams app</summary>

- Your collaborative app for Teams is a key product line or channel for your customers to use your SaaS service. For this reason, training your customer success personnel on the Teams app is of critical importance. It can include how to get customers started with the app, high value scenarios and use cases, how to get the most out of the app, and so on.

- For new customers who use Microsoft 365, your customer success team must know how to lead the conversations with your Teams collaborative app. Through collaborative workflows beyond the table stakes scenarios powered by your core SaaS product, it will offer your users unique and differentiated value.

- For existing customers who use Microsoft 365, your customer success team must immediately set up time to introduce your new Teams app to these customers and demo the experience. Then, they must work out a plan to activate these overlapping users on your Teams app.

- To achieve product-led growth, you must strategically upskill your customer success teams. The aim is to access and monitor product acquisition, engagement, and task completion. They must also monitor value realization metrics or milestones for customers using the app, so that performing outreach and intervention at the right time becomes possible to be able to assist users in their journey.

- In addition, establish a process to channel customer feedback from this team. Use this feedback to inform roadmap planning and growth experimentation for your Teams app. It will be a good idea to have your customer success team conversant in day-to-day usage of Microsoft Teams. It also helps if your team is up to speed with all articles in the Teams admin-facing public documentation sections [Third-party apps in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/overview-third-party-apps) and [Admin controls to govern apps](/microsoftteams/customize-apps). Your customers will benefit from their expertise in these areas.

<summary>Upskill customer support staff on new Teams app</summary>

Similar to customer success teams, it's imperative to train your customer support team on the Teams app. Upskill them on frequent user scenarios, common queries, and guidance for troubleshooting. It's also useful to train the team for any pre-configuration required, app rollout and governance of the Teams app in customer organizations. Your support team may get fairly nuanced queries about your app in Teams.

To continue delivering a delightful experience for your customers, ensure the support team has basic understanding of:

- Microsoft Teams.
- Apps on Microsoft Teams, in general.
- Nuances about your Teams collaborative app.
- Security, compliance, and permissions for your Teams app.
- App management and governance features in Teams.
  
It will be a good idea to have your support team conversant in day-to-day usage of Microsoft Teams. It also helps to be up to speed with all articles in the Teams admin-facing public documentation sections [Third-party apps in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/overview-third-party-apps) and [Admin controls to govern apps](/microsoftteams/customize-apps).

<summary>App activation in pre-identified pilot Teams customers</summary>

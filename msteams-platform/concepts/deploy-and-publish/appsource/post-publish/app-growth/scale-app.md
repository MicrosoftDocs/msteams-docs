# Scale your collaborative app

In this stage in the app growth lifecycle, you use the learnings from previous ad-hoc, pilot motions to programmatically activate existing customers and sell to new customers via all possible initiatives. The following growth levers are pertinent at this stage:

## What should you do during the Scale stage?

<br>
<details>
<summary>Become CSP channel ready for the Teams app</summary>

Once transact SaaS enabled, listing the SaaS subscriptions for your app on the Teams marketplace gives you access to 90,000+ reseller partners (called [cloud solution providers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X33C-RV9dZc) or CSPs) around the world. These CSPs manage a significant customer install base. You can scale your business through this channel without making a full investment in solutions, experts, salesforce, and events. You can instead get to market faster, and at exponential scale, compared to selling solely through your own sales motions.

To scale your app, become CSP channel ready (see [CSP Channel Readiness Guide for Teams app ISVs](https://aka.ms/TeamsMonetization/CSPChannelReadyGuide)). After that, your app appears on [Teams apps that have become CSP Channel Ready](https://aka.ms/P2PeBook) public handbook. Apps successful on the marketplace may have an opportunity to get featured on this frequently promoted public [landing page](https://cloudpartners.transform.microsoft.com/practices/modernworkisv?tab=monetize-your-app).

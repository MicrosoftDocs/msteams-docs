# Growth lifecycle for your app

Growing your app is a journey. It's a process that’s not overnight and goes through various stages. A typical growth lifecycle of a collaborative app on Teams looks like depicting critical barriers that once crossed puts the app into the next orbit for even higher growth:

:::image type="content" source="../../../../../assets/images/app-fundamentals/growth-lifecycle.png" alt-text="App growth lifecycle." lightbox="../../../../../assets/images/app-fundamentals/growth-lifecycle.png":::

- **Build stage**: In this stage, developers plan, envision, design, build, and publish their collaborative app on the Microsoft Teams marketplace. The Teams developer platform documentation is the one-stop shop for platform features, best practices, and developer guidance. Strategic developers can join an invite-only Teams engineering’s build-with partner program on this journey.

- **Launch stage**: After the collaborative app is published on the Teams marketplace, launch marketing initiatives are executed for the app to announce the availability of the app for existing and new or prospective customers.

- **Traction stage**: This stage has dual purpose and focus:

  - Building awareness for the app through impactful customer and seller marketing channels.
  - Building readiness of product, sales, customer success and support functions for the app’s upcoming adoption, growth, and ROI realization.

  Most growth and GTM activities during this stage are pilots to discover effectiveness, learning and execution rhythms. When the app crosses the *traction barrier*, one can say it has achieved product market fit in Teams marketplace and ecosystem.

- **Scale stage**: This stage encompasses scaling in the market on the back of activation in existing customers who use the SaaS app outside Teams and selling to new customers through product-led, sales-led, and channel-led initiatives. Growth and GTM activities become more programmatic at this stage. When the app crosses the scale barrier, often also referred to as the *growth barrier*, one can conclude the apps is ready to deliver on the business goals and starts to deliver ROI on engineering and GTM investments.

- **Succeed stage**: The final stage of the Teams collaborative app lifecycle is where the app moves from being a product integration built on Teams into a full-fledged strategic product line just as the core SaaS product for the web browser or native apps for Windows or mobile phones.

  The activities at this stage include:

  - Building public references for the impact of the collaborative app among customers to directly drives SQLs and MQLs
  - Optimizing customer sales and conversion based on PQLs
  - Investing further in more user-valuable scenarios or experiences inside the app

There may be examples of developers short circuiting the lifecycle to jump across stages, for example, directly starting to monetize their app after launch using their version 1 experience itself. It's recommended that you follow a stage-by-stage approach as a best practice that most developers follow to derive the best ROI from their Teams app journey.

## Review the Teams partners GTM guide

Get started first by reviewing (and sharing with your GTM leaders) this high-level visual [Guide to ISV success with Microsoft for Teams Partners](https://aka.ms/teamsappsGTMguide) flipbook. This resource orients you about how to plan and strategize your Teams app offering, insights about key industry-wise personas and trends, how to define your app’s value proposition, create content to maximize your app’s reach among customers and sellers, access various partner benefits available to you, how to visualize a simplistic customer journey with your app, how to align your marketing activities with key opportunities from Microsoft and how to sell your app via Microsoft’s global marketplace. As you can see from the flipbook, Microsoft partners with app developers once they’ve launched their apps on the marketplace by offering select, programmatic GTM investments depending on the app’s maturity in the market. You're encouraged to get in touch with your Microsoft field, account or engineering representatives before spending cycles on your app growth planning and execution, so that you can get the most appropriate guidance you’re eligible for.

## Step-by-step guide to grow your app

It's time now to expand on the preview provided by the flipbook above! The following sections offer a stage-by-stage  descriptive guide elaborating on the various growth initiatives developers can plan and execute and where Microsoft can help.

Developers are encouraged to follow the guidance here to grow their app and drive success for their investments on the Teams marketplace and ecosystem. However, the guidance provided can't be considered comprehensive. It's recommended that developers must always adapt these growth initiatives in the context best known to them based on:

- The nature of business.
- The app they’ve launched on Teams.
- The target customer personas.

### Launching your collaborative app

By now you're aware that the core focus at this stage is to announce the availability of the app for existing and new customers. Here’s a rundown of various initiatives and growth levers at your disposal:

#### What should you as a developer do during the Launch stage?

- **Invest strategically into your Microsoft Teams Store listing, landing page and documentation**

    Make sure you’ve links to your Teams app handy for use in your landing page, documentation, marketing materials and so on Refer here: Promote your app on another site to fetch the link to your app inside the Teams in-product marketplace. For AppSource link, head over to Microsoft AppSource and search for your app in the search box. Pick the URL from the browser’s address bar.

    | Growth Lever | Recommendation | Resources and examples for inspiration |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Teams Store listing | This is the description and metadata that appears on the public Teams marketplace and is the most important piece of text that conveys what your app can do and the value users can derive out of it. The Teams Store listing appears within the Teams Store in Teams clients as well as on the AppSource public marketplace on the web. Here’s some key guidance: <br> • Call out specifically what your app can do inside Teams vs focusing on your core SaaS product. Users are hiring your app to do a job in Teams, not in your web SaaS app for the browser or native mobile clients and want to certain it can deliver value inside Teams. It will be awesome if you can call out the degree of overlap in terms of supported scenarios between your core SaaS product and Teams app. <br> • Use bullet points and emojis to break the wall of text and achieve better readability <br> • Include screenshots in your listing that show the app’s experience and underscore the user value inside Teams. <br> • Include a video in your listing that shows the app’s experience inside Teams. Generic, marketing videos that talk about the user problem your app is solving or one that simply gives an overview of your entire SaaS product aren't meaningful, don’t convince the user to install your app and often set inaccurate user expectations leading to dissatisfaction. <br> • Make sure to include links to public references and success stories to build trust that your Teams app has already benefited customers. This will instill confidence in new customers looking to acquire or try your app. | Your Teams Store listing must meet the validation guidelines and Teams marketplace policies to be published. <br> Detailed guide for optimizing your Teams Store listing is here: Chapter 2 in Best Practices Guide <br> See Teams Store listings of Polly, Zoho, Atlassian and so on |
    | Landing page | This is the landing page for your app hosted on your website. You can use this page to talk about your Teams app in full detail – the value delivered inside Teams, personas targeted, key scenarios, details of subscription or pricing, customer testimonials and so on You can use this page to receive traffic from your core SaaS product or periodic digital or social campaigns. Here’s some key guidance: <br> • As you’ve built a collaborative app inside Teams, avoid labelling this as a “Teams integration” page and linking it under the “Integrations” section in your website header, navigation menu or footer. <br> • Your Teams collaborative app deserves a top-level link in your website header, navigation menu or footer. Make it easy to discover – more traffic is the first step to increased acquisition. <br> • Use the recommended Teams Store CTA arts on multiple places on this page prominently to direct users to acquire your app. <br> • Include beautiful video, animated gifs and artful screenshots of your real Teams app on this page for an impactful storytelling. Your goal should be to get everyone who lands on this page to try out your Teams app immediately. <br> • Make sure to include links to public references and success stories to build trust that your Teams app has already benefited customers. <br> • It’s a good practice to include a FAQ section where users can quickly find answers to their most common queries related to your Teams app for example, scenarios, features, any additional cost or pricing, which SaaS subscription plans of yours support the Teams app and so on <br> • Include download links to on-demand webinars or sign-up links to scheduled trainings or webinars or events for your Teams app on this page. Remember these are all valuable marketing qualified leads for your app. <br> • Include a section on this page to collect user feedback about the Teams app including new feature asks. You can also use the landing page to frequently showcase the planned roadmap for your Teams app and upcoming features that can be upvoted or downvoted against by users. <br> • This page must link to public pages as well as host downloadable copies of various bills of materials for your Teams app (see bill of materials section later on this page) that is, Technical solution datasheets, Teams app one-pager, IT admin guides, end-user facing app usage guides and so on <br> • Your detailed public Support or documentation page for the Teams app (see Documentation section below) must also be prominently discoverable on this page as users typically stumble upon the app’s landing page via search results. <br> • Add a link to this page in your core SaaS product (for example, web app, native mobile apps) and from periodic digital or social campaigns targeted at users who may be using Teams. <br> • You have a support chatbot available on your website to help visitors find the right information or get human assistance sooner, make sure to deploy and tune the same for visitors coming to this page for your Teams app. | Detailed guide for your website landing page is here: Chapter 3 in Best Practices Guide <br> You must use the following badge on your landing page to direct users to acquire your app from AppSource or the Teams in-client marketplace: <br> :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/app-fundamentals/app-badge.png" alt-text="Badge to acquire app from AppSource or Teams in-client marketplace."::: <br> See good examples of landing pages from Polly, Zoho, Atlassian and so on |
    | Documentation | Coinciding with your Teams app going live, you must ensure the following public documentation hosted on your website: <br> 1. Support page for Teams collaborative app: This page must contain any setup and configuration instructions required for the Teams app in your SaaS backend, app rollout and governance guidelines for IT admins, troubleshooting steps and so on for both IT admins and users if or when they run into specific problems, support FAQs, how to raise support requests for your Teams app, SLAs promised and so on Include links to download your app’s technical solution datasheet and IT admin facing guides on this page as well. <br> 2. Usage guide for Teams collaborative app: This is a highly recommended page to handhold new users in getting started with your app. It’s an opportunity to show how users can immediately get value by using your app inside Teams. Include links to download the Teams app one-pager and tend-user facing app usage guides on this page as well. We highly recommend adding a Share to Teams button on this page so that users who found this resource helpful can easily share this with their colleagues. | See good examples of support pages from Polly, Zoho, Atlassian and so on <br> See good examples of additional documentation pages from Wrike, Slido and so on |

- **New social media posts announcing the Teams collaborative app**

    You can generate interest from both existing and new customers as well as drive traffic to your app‘s landing page or directly to the app’s listing in Teams Marketplace through social media posts and paid campaigns executed on your social channels. Don’t forget to include media such as a video or an animated gif in your post to make it rich and interactive. Tag @M365 and @MicrosoftTeamsi in your posts as well as use the hashtags #Teamsapps, #MicrosoftTeams, #TeamsISV throughout the year in social media posts for your collaborative app to extend exposure and flag Microsoft’s social team for a potential retweet.

    :::row-end:::

- **Public blog post announcing the new Teams app**

    Blog posts help communicate the value of your app and its integration with Microsoft Teams to your audience. Use your blog to introduce your Teams app, how to use it and communicate the value prop for your users including use cases, scenarios, customer stories. Include logos, animated gifs, screenshots, quotes, URLs, and information pertinent to promoting your app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When using your blog channel to drive press or media coverage or to request Microsoft quotes, please refer to Microsoft’s Press Release guidelines for reviews (see the press release section). Example blog posts: Wrike, Adobe Creative Cloud, MeisterTask, MindMeister, Workday.

- **Press Release announcing the new Teams app**

    Use PRs to publicly announce the application you've built and your collaboration with Microsoft. Note that press releases and quotes must be reviewed by Microsoft representatives. Connect with the Microsoft 365 ISV Benefits Service Desk to avail of the service to review your press release draft and get a quote from Microsoft. Once you publicly post your press release, evangelize through other channels. Microsoft doesn't post partner press releases. Example press releases.

- **Banners in web SaaS app to announce the new Teams app**

    :::row:::
        :::column span="3":::
            Include in-product CTAs prominently in your web SaaS product to let users know about your new or updated Teams collaborative app. You can leverage transient banners, notifications bar, what’s new notifications inside the SaaS product’s UI for all users or push notifications to relevant users such as those belonging to your customer organizations who use Microsoft 365. The banner or notification CTA can direct users to your app‘s landing page or directly to the app’s listing in Teams Marketplace.

        :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::
 
- **Free and extended trials for new Teams users**

    Since your goal at this stage is to achieve product-market fit for your app, it’s critical to learn how users are perceiving your new app and if they’re getting the intended value by using the app. If not already done for your core SaaS product, offer free trials to users who sign up for your app (and SaaS service) through the Teams channel. If you already offer trials for your SaaS product and your standard free trial period is 15 days, consider extending the trial period for Teams users to 30-60 days. Given you’ve built your Teams app for collaborative use cases, you'll naturally want trial users to invite their colleagues as well to use your app in shared context inside Teams. An extended trial facilitates collaborative evaluation of your app and increases the likelihood of these users converting to paid and sticky customers.

- **Launch offers and promotions to acquire users for Teams app**

    To acquire new customers for your Teams collaborative app, consider offering a little extra incentive to Teams users over and above what’s available for your core SaaS product.

    :::row:::
        :::column span="3":::
            If your app requires paid subscriptions, consider offering launch period discounts. Even promotions such as 1:1 product demos, customer success consultations, invite-only webinars, trainings for the entire business unit or team using your Teams app can go a long way to differentiate your app and accelerate customer acquisition. If you've already listed your transactable SaaS subscriptions for the Teams app in the marketplace, make sure to price them at a discount to encourage users to purchase your offer directly from the Teams marketplace.

        :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::

- **Announce Teams app to your entire customer base**

    The first time your Teams app goes live on the marketplace as well as for major subsequent updates, consider outreach to your entire customer base announcing the availability of the app. While social media posts, public blog post and press releases are for the entire world audience, to-customer emails are the best channel to drive awareness about your app within existing customer organizations. Make sure to introduce your Teams app, how to use it and communicate the value prop for your users very briefly including use cases, scenarios, customer stories via animated gifs, screenshots, quotes, and CTAs to your app’s public landing page and install links to the Teams marketplace for those willing to get started immediately.

### Gaining traction for your collaborative app in the market

As a reminder, you’ll now want to gain mindshare for your collaborative app among top customers and build readiness to scale adoption, growth and start realizing return on investment. Here are the various initiatives and growth levers at your disposal:

#### What should you as a developer do during the Traction stage?

- **Upskill Customer Success team on your new Teams app**:

    Your collaborative app for Teams is just another product line or channel for your customers to use your SaaS service and hence, training your customer success personnel on the Teams app, especially how to get customers started with the app, high value scenarios and use cases, how to get the most out of the app and so on is of critical importance. For new customers who use Microsoft 365, your customer success team must lead the conversations with your Teams collaborative app as it will offer unique, differentiated value to users through collaborative workflows beyond the high value scenarios powered by your core SaaS product. For existing customers who use Microsoft 365, your customer success team must immediately set up time to introduce your new Teams app to these customers, demo the experience and then work out a plan to activate these overlapping customers on Teams. To achieve product-led growth, you must strategically upskill your customer success teams to access and monitor product acquisition, engagement, task completion and value realization metrics or milestone for customers using your collaborative Teams app to perform outreach and intervention at the right time to assist users in their journey with your app. Also establish a process to channel customer feedback from this team to inform roadmap planning and growth experimentation for your Teams app. It will be a good idea to have your customer success team conversant in day-to-day usage of Microsoft Teams and up to speed with all topics in the Teams admin-facing public documentation sections “Third-party apps in Microsoft Teams” and “Admin controls to govern apps” since your customers will need this expertise.

- **Upskill Customer Support staff on new Teams app**:

    Similar to Customer Success teams, it's imperative to train your customer support team on the Teams app, frequent user scenarios, common queries, guidance w.r.t. troubleshooting, any pre-configuration required, app rollout and governance of the Teams app in customer organizations. Your support team may get fairly nuanced queries about your app in Teams and to continue delivering a delightful experience for your customers, you must ensure the team has basic understanding of Microsoft Teams, Teams apps in general, nuances about your Teams collaborative app, security, compliance and permissions for your Teams app, app management and governance features in Teams among other things. It will be a good idea to have a support team that’s conversant in day-to-day usage of Microsoft Teams and is up to speed with all topics in the Teams admin-facing public documentation sections “Third-party apps in Microsoft Teams” and “Admin controls to govern apps” as your customers will need this expertise.

- **Showcase Teams app in your annual customer conference**:

    Your own flagship annual customer or partner conference is the perfect opportunity to announce and showcase your new or updated Teams collaborative app to the world and get immediate traction going. Get in touch with your Microsoft field, account, or engineering representatives to request their participation in to-customer webinars you’re planning to announce and evangelize your Teams collaborative app.

- **Drive awareness of the app in select customer orgs**:

    While at the launch stage you’d announced the availability of your new Teams app to the entire customer base, it’s time to build traction by going targeted. Identify a shorter list of existing customers of your SaaS product who use Microsoft 365 and then drive awareness among these customers through your customer success team. Your customer success team must set up time to introduce your new Teams app to these customers, demo the experience and then work out a plan to activate these overlapping customers on Teams. These activation motions will allow your customer success and customer support teams to learn how to drive programmatic adoption, tackle common customer queries and build real-world expertise on the Teams app.
- **App activation in pre-identified pilot Teams customers**:

    Before shipping the Teams app on the marketplace, you would have identified 3-5 pilot customers with whom you reviewed the envisioned app scenarios and design mocks to build confidence towards the product you’re building. It’s now time to leverage your customer success team to activate those select 3-5 customers. This won't only lead towards product-market fit but also serve as a source of rich customer feedback to improve the app in future versions.

- **Share overlapping customer orgs to plan co-activation**:

    For large, strategic enterprise customers that use your SaaS product as well as Microsoft Teams, Microsoft’s customer-facing resources can partner with your sales and customer success teams to drive co-activation of your app in the customer organization. Note that Microsoft evaluates co-activation opportunities for apps based on customer interest, adoption opportunity (sold seat size in customer account) and so on among other criteria. Get in touch with your Microsoft field, account, or engineering representatives to request potential, co-activation of your Teams collaborative app in strategic enterprise customer accounts.

- **Commerce transact integration to make your Teams app monetization-ready**:

    One of the goals of the Traction stage is to build readiness for future adoption and ROI realization from your collaborative Teams app. Once you start seeing sticky adoption and positive feedback for your collaborative app among the pilot and significant customers, you can begin planning monetization for your app on the Teams marketplace. Get started here.

- **M365 Certification to make Teams app enterprise-ready**:

    The Microsoft 365 Certification is designed to show customers that your collaborative app has been vetted against controls derived from leading industry-standard frameworks and that strong security, privacy and compliance practices are in place to protect customer data when the app is in use. Since most Teams customers are large enterprises, having your app M365 certified aids in building trust with the IT admins (see how here) as well as result in smoother, faster adoption in customer organizations. Find more here.

- **Drive traffic from web SaaS app: “Use in Teams” CTA and “Share to Teams”**:

    While during the launch stage, you leveraged transient banners, notifications bar, what’s new notifications inside the SaaS product’s UI for all users to announce your Teams app. It’s time now to nudge users who may be using Microsoft Teams to start using your collaborative app for scenarios that are better together in Teams vs your core web SaaS experience.

    :::row:::
        :::column span="3":::
            Surface deeplinks within your browser-based web SaaS experience to transport users to specific views inside your Teams app (for example, personal app, tabs, conversational bot or meeting extensions with shared meeting stage or in-meeting tab) and implement the highly recommended Share to Teams control within your browser-based web SaaS experience to enable users to share and start collaborating around a content or object from your SaaS product inside Teams with their colleagues.
        :::column-end:::

        :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::

    To get maximum ROI, surface these nudges contextually for scenarios which are inherently collaborative over chat or in meetings as those are best delivered inside Microsoft Teams through your app.

### Scaling your collaborative app

To reiterate, this stage is all about putting learnings from previous ad-hoc, pilot motions to use in programmatically activating existing customers and selling to new customers via all possible initiatives. The following growth levers are pertinent at this stage:

#### What should you as a developer do during the Scale stage?

- **Become CSP channel ready for the Teams app**:

    Listing your SaaS subscriptions on the Teams marketplace gives you access to 90,000+ reseller partners (called cloud solution providers or CSPs) around the world who already manage a significant customer install base. You can scale your business through this channel without making a full investment in solutions, experts, salesforce, and events - but instead get to market faster and at exponential scale compared to selling solely through your own sales motions. To scale your app, become CSP channel ready (see here: CSP Channel Readiness Guide for Teams app ISVs). Once your app becomes CSP ready, it will get featured on this landing page to appear in Teams apps that have become CSP Channel Ready public handbook.

- **Onboard CSP resellers to extend app’s sales reach**:

    Once you become CSP channel ready by completing the pre-requisites detailed here, browse through the CSP list on the Partner Center to find resellers you can get in touch with to negotiate a partnership. You can find detailed partner profile information in the Partner Center or using the public partner finder on AppSource.

- **Tailor SaaS offers for customers and CSP resellers**:

    Teams marketplace allows you to create private offers that is, time-bound pricing of your SaaS subscription for Teams app with customized, pre-negotiated terms for CSPs. You can also create private plans for targeted customers to offer negotiated pricing. Help your sales team secure large new customer deals leading with your Teams collaborative app and offering private pricing to your customers via the Teams marketplace – leaving tax remittance, payments, and subscription billing to Microsoft.

- **Digital webinars for existing customers and new prospects**:

    Host digital webinars at regular cadences to showcase the value of your Microsoft Teams app to customers. Your customer success team and pre-sales or sales team must funnel relevant existing customers and new prospects as leads to target these webinar invitations to. Make sure to include the links to sign-up for these webinars on your app’s landing page on your website and also in your Teams Store listing to attract new, exploratory users who may be interested in learning more about the app. Get in touch with your Microsoft field, account or engineering representatives to request their participation in hero instances of these to-customer webinars.

- **Digital ad campaigns to target customers for app install and use**:

    Generate interest from new customer accounts and drive traffic to your collaborative app listing in Teams marketplace with paid media campaigns executed on your social channels. Connect with the Microsoft 365 ISV Benefits Service Desk to seek guidance for your digital campaign, identify target customer accounts and personas, collaboration on paid media plan, possible budget funding and agreeing on the success metrics you should measure for example, click through rate, cost per click, # of clicks, no. of MQLs generated on the landing page, # of visitors to the app’s listing in marketplace, resulting # of Teams app installs, and so on.

- **Publish customer demand and app’s impact story**:

    :::row:::
        :::column span="3":::
            Share real customer stories of increased employee productivity by using your collaborative app inside Teams with a 4–5-minute video that can be used for demand generation, digital marketing campaigns or showcased on public pages. Nominate a customer and gain their commitment to participate in the story. Work with the customer on the narrative and be sure to include the benefits derived from your collaborative app, as well as the added productivity gains seen by the customer (quantifiable gains are preferred).

        :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::

    Once developed, you must host one or more of these customer stories prominently on the landing page of the Teams app on your website and promote it via paid, earned media or social media posts to highlight the success of the app.

- **Showcase Teams app in leading industry events**:

    While building traction, you showcased the collaborative app in Teams during your annual customer conference. It’s time to expand the coverage to well-known public industry events where you've a prominent presence or conferences which you sponsor. Your executives can include the Teams app in their keynote or showcase your innovation centre-stage, which is bound to attract both existing and new prospective customers.

- **User re-targeting and re-engagement basis app analytics**:

    :::row:::
        :::column span="3":::

        :::column-end:::
    :::row-end:::

    Remember, your goal is to get users to frequently experience value by using your collaborative app, so that they can convert to sticky, habitual users and eventually convert into paying customers.

- **Co-activation in mutually identified existing customers**:

    Based on the list you’ve shared with your Microsoft field, account or engineering representatives while building traction, it’s time to execute co-activation and adoption of your collaborative app in customer accounts with significant seat sizes. Your customer success team will play a major driving role in this motion working alongside business decision makers, IT decision makers and end-users that is, employees of the customer organization who are going to use your app inside Teams. Just enabling the app inside Teams won't be enough – instead, adoption and change management practices led by your customer success team through org-wide emailers at regular cadences, flyers, retention campaigns, user trainings, identifying and scaling through app champions in each team and constantly keeping an eye on app usage metrics within the customer’s tenant is required to form a habit among users.

- **Growth hacking via in-product scenario experimentation**:

    Continuously monitor what’s happening inside your collaborative app through analytics and measure the value end-users are obtaining. To positively impact product and business metrics such as # of app installs, activation rate, task completing, new user retention and churn, referrals and so on, a rapid, always-on experimentation work-stream allows byte-sized tweaks to your app experience, resulting in more control and lesser risk compared to monolithic, big changes spaced far apart. Make sure to instrument code and track analytics for your app right from the very first version and have your dedicated Teams app crew or your existing SaaS product growth team of PM, Dev, Design upskilled on Teams platform to take ownership of this work-stream to derive maximum ROI.

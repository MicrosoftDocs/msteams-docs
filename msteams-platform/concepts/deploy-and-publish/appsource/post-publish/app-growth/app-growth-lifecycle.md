# Growth lifecycle for your app

Growing your app follows a defined journey. It involves a process that evolves over multiple stages. A typical growth lifecycle of a collaborative app on Teams depicts critical barriers that, once overcome, move the app into the next orbit for higher growth:

- **Build stage**: Developers plan, envision, design, build, and publish their collaborative app on Teams Marketplace at this stage. Teams developer platform documentation provides a one-stop resource for platform features, best practices, and developer guidance. Strategic developers join an invite-only Teams engineering’s build-with partner program during this journey.

- **Launch stage**: After publishing the collaborative app on Teams Marketplace, launch marketing initiatives announce the app’s availability for existing, new, or prospective customers.

- **Traction stage**: This stage focuses on two areas:

  - Building awareness for the app through high-impact customer and seller marketing channels.
  - Preparing product, sales, customer success, and support teams for upcoming adoption, growth, and ROI realization.

  Most GTM and growth activities during this stage involve pilots to discover effectiveness, learning, and execution rhythms. When the app overcomes the *traction barrier*, it achieves product market fit in Teams Marketplace and ecosystem.

- **Scale stage**: This stage involves expanding market reach by activating existing customers who use the SaaS app outside Teams and acquiring new customers through product-led, sales-led, and channel-led initiatives. GTM and growth activities become more programmatic. When the app overcomes the scale barrier, also known as the *growth barrier*, the app demonstrates readiness to meet business goals and deliver ROI on engineering and GTM investments.

- **Succeed stage**: In the final stage of the Teams collaborative app lifecycle, the app evolves from a Teams-integrated product into a strategic product line, similar to a core SaaS product for web browsers or native apps for Windows or mobile phones.

  Activities at this stage include:

  - Building public references that directly drive SQLs and MQLs by highlighting app impact among customers.
  - Optimizing sales and conversion processes based on PQLs.
  - Investing further in high-value user scenarios or experiences within the app.

Some developers may bypass stages, for example, by starting to monetize their app immediately after launch using a version 1 experience. Following a stage-by-stage approach remains a best practice that most developers follow to derive optimum ROI from their Teams app journey.

## Review the Teams partners GTM guide

Begin by reviewing (and sharing with your GTM leaders) this high-level visual [Guide to ISV success with Microsoft for Teams Partners](https://aka.ms/teamsappsGTMguide) flipbook. This resource explains how to plan and strategize your Teams app offering, provides insights on key industry personas and trends, explains how to define your app’s value proposition, guides you on creating content to maximize your app’s reach with customers and sellers, outlines available partner benefits, depicts a simplified customer journey with your app, aligns marketing activities with key opportunities from Microsoft, and illustrates how to sell your app through Microsoft’s global marketplace. As the flipbook shows, Microsoft partners with app developers once they publish their apps on Marketplace by offering select, programmatic GTM investments that depend on the app’s market maturity. Get in touch with your Microsoft field, account, or engineering representatives before investing cycles on your app growth planning and execution to receive the most relevant guidance.

## Step-by-step guide to grow your app

Expand on the preview provided by the flipbook above! The sections that follow offer a stage-by-stage descriptive guide, elaborating on the growth initiatives developers can plan and execute and where Microsoft can help.

Developers follow this guidance to grow their app and drive success for their investments on Teams Marketplace and ecosystem. Note that this guidance is not comprehensive. Developers always adapt these growth initiatives based on:

- Nature of business.
- App launched on Teams.
- Target customer personas.

## Best practices for app growth and adoption

To accelerate growth of third-party apps and increase adoption rates, consider these strategies:

- **Leverage freemium model**: A basic freemium account improves user conversion rates by allowing users to experience core app benefits before incurring costs. Offer a free trial period of 30 days.

- **Integrate shareable call-to-action**: Implement a dynamic call-to-action (CTA) button within an Adaptive Card. This enables users to share your app easily and onboard team members, fostering organic growth.

- **Implement adoption change management**: Maintain consistent communication with users. Regularly update them on new and existing features via email to sustain interest and encourage continuous use.

- **Identify and resolve blockers**: Proactively address issues to drive app adoption. Collaborate with partners to gather feedback and remove any barriers hindering user experience.

- **Embrace growth marketing**: Develop a dynamic growth marketing strategy tailored for SaaS offers that drives usage through data-driven techniques and user engagement analytics.

  Recommendations for growth marketing strategies include:

  - Sending active email notifications to users with a CTA to the Teams app.
  - Conducting targeted social media campaigns with direct links to the Teams app.
  - Securing premium placement for the ISV Teams app on SaaS platforms complete with a CTA to the Teams app.
  - Creating informative blog posts, tutorials, or webinars showcasing the unique features of your Teams app.

Adopting these methods increases app installations, sustains engagement, and fosters growth over time. For more information, see [educate users and drive adoption change management for your app](~/promote-app-adoption.md#step-3-educate-users-and-drive-adoption-change-management-for-your-app).

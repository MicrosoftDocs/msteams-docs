# Succeed with your collaborative app

To wrap up, your collaborative app is now becoming a full-fledged strategic product line, just as your core SaaS product for the web browser or native apps for Windows or mobile phones. To maximize success for your customers and ROI for your business, this section covers the initiatives and growth levers you must use. The following growth levers are pertinent at this stage:

## What should you do during this final stage?

<br>
<details>
<summary>Wider TAM coverage across existing and prospect user base</summary>

Continue to increase the usage of your collaborative app on Teams through existing customer activation. You can continue new customer acquisition via the Teams marketplace or through sales-led customer deal wins leading with your collaborative app.

To plan and support the rollout of your Teams app in your customers’ organizations, follow the guidance, resources, and best practices available [here](../../../../../promote-app-adoption.md).

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Report and celebrate customer activation, deal wins and revenue</summary>

Share notable customer wins, customer success stories, and resulting revenue from user acquisition or deal wins attributed to your Teams app with the Microsoft field, account, or engineering representatives. Microsoft can selectively drive executive visibility for your app and explore any possible GTM or marketing-drive acceleration for your app.

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Convert PQLs from Teams app into active sales pipeline</summary>

A core product-led growth initiative is capturing Teams marketplace trials, trials sign-ups coming from your Teams app or freemium users into potential leads to be converted into paying customers. Remember to monitor the usage patterns, user retention, and product value experienced by the trial or freemium users. Use them to determine the customers that can be converted through sales, customer success, or direct product interventions (for example, upsell, upgrade prompts).

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Deepen investment into Teams-app driven growth engine</summary>

This stage is ripe to further sales, customer success and product-led initiatives to grow your SaaS business leading with the Teams collaborative app product line you’ve built. Consider making further investments into your sales, customer success, marketing and product teams who are responsible for the Teams app so that you can win more customer deals, collaborate with Microsoft on GTM and realize net new economic value through purchases and renewals on the commercial marketplace.

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Continuously reduce churn via product and analytics-led insights</summary>

Retaining users by providing them with a sticky experience is key to growing your Teams app and realizing economic value from your product and GTM investments. Ensure that you’ve [implemented robust and granular analytics](../../../../design/overview-analytics.md) for your Teams app. It should serve your need to measure when and which users have churned or are likely to churn from your app. You can them re-engage and retarget them via outreach channels within or outside your app.

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary>Invest in richer and more impactful user scenarios</summary>

Innovation, grounded in customer needs, is the key to sustainably grow and succeed with your app on Teams.

Ensure that you monitor reviews for your app on the marketplace, user feedback coming from in-product surveys, and user behavior insights. You must also monitor app engagement analytics you’ve implemented in your app. Also, monitor customer inputs relayed by your Microsoft field, account, or engineering representatives. It helps you to continue investing in new scenarios and enhanced user experience for your collaborative app.

Keep an eye on your competitors and other leading SaaS apps in your segment to continuously learn from the market and evolve your app’s strategy and roadmap. Since Teams marketplace is public, your product team can at the minimum use the [Microsoft 365 developer sandbox](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program) to experience other apps.

However you can always discover and use Microsoft Teams platform features that are in [public developer preview](../../../../../whats-new.md?pivots=dev-preview).

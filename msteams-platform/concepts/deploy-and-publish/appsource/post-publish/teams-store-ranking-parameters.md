# Microsoft Teams store ranking parameters

The information in this disclosure statement applies to the Microsoft Teams store in which Microsoft makes third-party apps available to users. The Microsoft Teams store ranks app search results in the store using a set of ranking parameters to deliver relevant search results to users. The ranking parameters listed aren't exhaustive and they're intended to provide our publisher community with a high-level understanding of the main parameters the storefront use in ranking determinations. All defined terms used but not otherwise defined herein will have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement.

The Microsoft Teams store editorial team determines the prominence and location of an app within the Editorial sections such as promo banner on the Microsoft Teams store based on ranking parameters, and are used as objective criteria applied equally to all apps in the Microsoft Teams store that includes Microsoft’s own apps and all third-party developer apps. Following are the main parameters used to determine app placements:

* Historical usage data: Apps with higher volumes of usage in the Teams store tend to rank higher than apps with lower usage.

* User engagement data: Apps with higher user engagement in the Teams store tend to rank higher than apps with lower engagement.

* App quality and value:  Apps that have distinct value and provide a high-quality user experience tend to rank higher.

* Audience relevance: Apps that are likely to be more relevant to a particular audience (for example, based on their language settings and license type such as, Education, Enterprise, or Small and Medium business) tend to rank higher than apps that are likely to be less relevant.

* App update or new release: Newly released or updated high-quality apps tend to rank higher than apps that were released or updated on an earlier date.

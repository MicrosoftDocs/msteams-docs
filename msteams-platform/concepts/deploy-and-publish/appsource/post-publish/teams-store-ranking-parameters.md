# Teams Store ranking parameters

The information in this disclosure statement applies to the Microsoft Teams Store in which Microsoft makes third-party apps available to users. The Teams Store ranks app search results in the Teams Store using a set of ranking parameters to deliver relevant search results to users.

The ranking parameters listed in this section aren't exhaustive. They're intended to provide our publisher community with a high-level understanding of the main parameters that the storefront uses in ranking determinations.

> [!NOTE]
> All defined terms used but not otherwise defined herein will have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Microsoft Publisher Agreement.

The Teams Store editorial team determines the prominence and location of an app on the Teams Store based on ranking parameters. Such parameters may include promo banner within the editorial section. They're used as objective criteria applied equally to all apps in the Teams Store. It includes Microsoft’s own apps and all third-party developer apps.

The main parameters used to determine app placements include:

- **Historical usage data**: Apps with higher volumes of usage in the Teams Store globally as well as organization-level tend to rank higher than apps with lower usage for that organization. However, this criterion isn't mandatory as the goal is to promote the introduction of new apps in the Teams Store.

- **User engagement data**: Apps with higher user engagement in the Teams Store tend to rank higher than apps with lower engagement.

- **App quality and value**: Apps that offer unique value and provide a high-quality user experience tend to rank better. Higher ratings and genuine reviews indicate the app's superior quality.

- **Audience relevance**: Apps more relevant to a particular audience tend to rank higher than apps that are less relevant for that audience. Such apps can be based on the audience's language settings and license type such as, Education, Enterprise, or Small and Medium business.

> [!NOTE]
> The information on main parameters applies to specific surfaces in the store but not to the entire store.

The criteria mentioned above are neither mandatory nor exhaustive. They can vary based on business requirements and industry standards.

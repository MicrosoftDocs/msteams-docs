## Description

A good description offers a clear and concise summary of the Copilot agent's features. It enhances user awareness and allows Microsoft 365 Copilot to efficiently discover and execute search operations.

You must ensure to meet the following guidelines for Copilot agents:

* The Teams Store validation guidelines related to app description for Microsoft 365 apps are applicable. For more information, see [app descriptions](teams-store-validation-guidelines.md#app-descriptions).
* Short description of Copilot agent, parameter, command description, semantic description, and operation ID mustn't include:
  * Instructional phrases, for example, “if the user says X”, “ignore”, “delete”, “reset”, “new instructions”, “Answer in Bold”, or “Do not print anything”. [*Must fix*]
  * URLs, emojis, or hidden characters such as hexadecimal, binary, or unconventional symbols. [*Must fix*]
  * Grammar and punctuation errors. [*Must fix*]
  * Overly verbose, flowery, or marketing language. [*Good-to-fix*]
  * Superlative claims such as “#1,” “amazing,” or “best”. [*Good-to-fix*]

  > [!NOTE]
  > * In case of declarative agents, the short description guidelines apply to the `instructions` and `conversation_starters` fields also.
  > * For API based plugins, these guidelines apply to `description_for_human`, `description_for_model`, `capabilities`, `conversation_starters` (both the title and and text), `states\reasoning\description` in `functions` fields, if provided. [*Must fix*]
  > * When utilizing Swagger or OpenAPI file formats, adhere to these guidelines for the `path` content associated with keys and the `description` field for GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE APIs. [*Must fix*]

* App long description must clearly call out that the Copilot agent works in Microsoft 365 Copilot. For example, use Contoso in Microsoft 365 Copilot to search and summarize your tasks. ​[*Must fix*]

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/validation-guidelines-plugin-prompt-pass.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a pass scenario with an example of a sample prompt for message extension plugin in Microsoft 365 Copilot.":::

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/validation-guidelines-plugin-prompt-fail.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a fail scenario without an example of sample prompt for message extension as a plugin in Microsoft 365 Copilot.":::

* The `semanticDescription` property isn't a mandatory field. However, if you add `semanticDescription` in app manifest, the existing validation checks for short, parameter, and command descriptions are also applicable for semantic descriptions.

## Prompts

You must ensure the following guidelines for sample prompts and prompt starters.

### Sample prompts

The [`samplePrompts`](../../../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#composeextensionscommands) property provides guidance to users on utilizing the various plugins in Microsoft 365 Copilot.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/bot-based-sample-prompts.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the sample prompts displayed when the message extension plugin is enabled in Microsoft 365 Copilot.":::

Sample prompts are specified using `samplePrompts` property in the app manifest. These prompts must meet the following requirements:

* A plugin must have at least three prompts and maximum of five prompts for each command. [*Must fix*]
* Each prompt mustn't exceed 128 characters. [*Must fix*]
* Two commands within the same plugin mustn't have identical prompts. [*Must fix*]
* Sample prompts must be generic in nature and not include custom references. For example, project names and task name. [*Must fix*]
* All sample prompts must be functional and return responses. [*Must fix*]
* Prompt must be relevant to the commands. [*Must fix*]

### Prompt starters

Prompt starters guide users on how to start using declarative agents. You must ensure the following guidelines for prompt starters:

* A declarative agent must have at least three prompts and maximum of six prompts. [*Must fix*]
* All prompt starters must be functional and return responses. [*Must fix*]
* It must be generic in nature and not include custom references, for example, project names and task name. [*Must fix*]

[Back to top](#validation-guidelines-for-copilot-agents)

## Adaptive Card response

Copilot agent responses provided as an Adaptive Card must meet the following requirements:

* Adaptive Card response must include Adaptive Card content and preview card information as part of the same template. [*Must fix*]

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/validation-guidelines-app-response-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of a sample app showing Microsoft 365 Copilot app response contains preview and content in the same response.":::

* Apart from the Copilot agent logo, title, thumbnail, and title of the information, the data in the Adaptive Card must represent at least two pieces of information. You can identify the fields from the most frequently searched attributes such as data modified, author, status, and flags. [*Must fix*]

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/validation-guidelines-plugin-functional-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of information title, additional user fields, and action button in an Adaptive Card response.":::

* Adaptive Card must be well-formatted to suit the desktop, web, and mobile (iOS and Android) clients. [*Must fix*]
* Adaptive Cards must include a URL as part of the [metadata](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Metadata.html), which allows cards to be easily copied from one hub to another. [*Must fix*]

[Back to top](#validation-guidelines-for-copilot-agents)

## Compatibility

Copilot agents must be fully responsive and functional on the latest versions of these clients: [*Must fix*]

* Microsoft Teams on desktop and web
* copilot.microsoft.com on web
* Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word

### Ensure your Copilot plugins work in Teams meetings

You must implement the following:

* Adaptive Cards mustn't display a horizontal scroll. To avoid horizontal scrolls, don’t specify a fixed width: [*Must fix*]

  * **ColumnSets**

    * Don't define `ColumnSets` with more than three columns.
    * Don’t use explicit pixel width on more than one column in the set.
    * Ensure the column doesn't exceed one-quarter of the narrowest card width, such as in a meeting chat or Microsoft 365 Copilot.
    * Generally, an explicit width mustn't exceed 48 pixels, though some scenarios might allow for exceptions.

  * **Sizing images**

    * When using an image inside a `ColumnSet` with more than one column, specify the size of the column containing an image rather than the image itself.
    * If the image isn’t in a `ColumnSet`, we recommend you to set its size to `auto` or `stretch`.
    * If you want to define an explicit width in pixels, ensure that it doesn’t exceed three-fourths of the narrowest card width.
    * If you want to define explicit size in pixels, define it for the width or height. Setting explicit size for any one parameter preserves the image's aspect ratio.
    * We recommend that you set the width of the image, though some scenarios might allow for exceptions.

## Technical requirements

For a Copilot agent to be validated, invoked, and to work seamlessly, ensure that it meets the following criteria: [*Must fix*]

| Criteria | Fulfillment |
|---|---|
| Manifest version | *App manifest version must be 1.13 or later. [*Must fix*] <br>* If you're using declarative agent, you must use [public developer preview app manifest schema](../../../../resources/schema/manifest-schema-dev-preview.md). [*Must fix*] |
| Response time | Response time mustn't exceed nine seconds for 99 percent, five seconds for 75 percent and two seconds for 50 percent. [*Must fix*] |
| Reliability | Apps must maintain 99.9% availability. For instance, if Microsoft 365 Copilot calls a plugin 1,000 times, it must provide a meaningful response 999 times. [*Must fix*] |
| Zero regressions | If you need to resubmit your Copilot agent for validation, the existing message extension functionality that was working earlier mustn't break. This requirement is only applicable to independent software vendor (ISV) apps and not apps built for your organization. [*Must fix*] |
| Microsoft 365 channel | For users to interact with your message extension from Outlook, you need to add Microsoft 365 channel to your bot. For more information, see [add Microsoft 365 channel for your app](../../../../m365-apps/extend-m365-teams-message-extension.md#add-microsoft-365-channel-for-your-app). [*Must fix*]|
| Single sign-on (SSO) | If applicable, update your Microsoft Entra app registration for SSO. [*Must fix*] |
| Content Security Policy (CSP) | If applicable, modify your CSP headers and X-Frame-Options in accordance with [configure Content Security Policy headers](/microsoftteams/platform/m365-apps/extend-m365-teams-personal-tab?tabs=manifest-teams-toolkit#configure-content-security-policy-headers). [*Must fix*] |

## User disclosure and confirmation for action scenarios

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/dc-user-disclosure-confirmation.png" alt-text="The image shows an example of user disclosure and user confirmation." lightbox="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/dc-user-disclosure-confirmation.png" :::

For action scenarios, Copilot agents must share user disclosure and seek user confirmation:

* Data shown in third-party service (through dialogue) must be reflective of confirmation provided by the user. [*Must fix*]
* A confirmation of the completion of the action must be shared by the plugin in the form of a card. [*Must fix*]
* Action taken by a user must be correctly reflected in third-party service. [*Must fix*]
* Modification requests by the user prior to confirmation of the action must be honored. [*Must fix*]
* Highly consequential tasks such as bulk delete mustn't be supported. [*Good-to-fix*]

[Back to top](#validation-guidelines-for-copilot-agents)

## Copilot agent must have Action or knowledge source

Your Copilot agent must have nodes defined as actions or Graph connectors in the app manifest. This ensures that the Copilot agent's responses are grounded in a data source. [*Must fix*]

[Back to top](#validation-guidelines-for-copilot-agents)

## Graceful error handling

All Copilot agents must handle the following scenarios gracefully, that is, the agent must reject the user request and provide a way forward: [*Must fix*]

* For incorrect search parameters
* For misuse or inappropriate language
* For topics in which the Copilot agent doesn’t specialize

  For example, graceful error message with way forward for declarative agent:

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/graceful-error-handling.png" alt-text="The screenshot shows how to incorporate graceful error handling." lightbox="../../../../assets/images/Copilot/graceful-error-handling.png":::

[Back to top](#validation-guidelines-for-copilot-agents)

## Security requirements for OpenAPI spec URL

Copilot agents that use OpenAPI specs must ensure the following security standards:

* All API calls must use HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. [*Must fix*]
* API calls mustn't lead to any URL redirection. Actual API calls must be served from the same domain or subdomain as the root domain verified for the developer. [*Must fix*]

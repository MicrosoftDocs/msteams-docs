# Teams Store validation guidelines

Following these guidelines increases the chances of your app to pass the Microsoft Teams Store submission process. The Teams-specific guidelines complement the Microsoft [commercial marketplace certification policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1140-teams) and are updated frequently to reflect new capabilities, user feedback, and business rule changes.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Some guidelines may not be applicable to your app. For example, if your app doesn't include a bot, you can ignore bot-related guidelines.
> * We've cross-referenced these guidelines to the Microsoft commercial certification policies and added Do’s and Don’ts with examples from pass or fail scenarios encountered in our validation process.
> * Certain guidelines are marked as *Mandatory Fix*. If your app submission doesn't meet these mandatory guidelines, you'll receive a failure report from us with steps to mitigate. Your app submission will pass Teams Store validation only after you have fixed the issues.
> * Other guidelines are marked as *Suggested Fix*. For an ideal user experience, we suggest that you fix the issues, however, your app submission will not be blocked from publishing on the Teams Store, if you choose not to fix the issues.

## Value proposition

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.1](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11401-value-proposition-and-offer-requirements) and provides more guidance to developers of Microsoft Teams apps on their offer’s value proposition.

Apps must provide value to the users by enabling them to complete functional workflows that encourage repeated use. Expand the following sections to know more about the value proposition:
<br><br>

<details><summary>Tabs</summary>

Tabs must provide value beyond hosting an existing website. [*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-app-provides-workflows.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of an app with a workflow valuable to channel members within a team.":::

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-usability-website-i-framed.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of an app with entire website in an I-frame without any back option.":::

</details>
<br>

<details><summary>Notification bots</summary>
A notification provides value in Teams if:

1. Posted card or text provides adequate details requiring no further user action.
1. Posted card or text provides adequate preview information for a user to take action or decide to view further details in a link opening outside Teams.

Apps that provide only notifications with content such as, **You have a new notification** or **click to view**, and require the user to navigate outside Teams for everything else don't provide significant value within Teams.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-notification-only-inadequete-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of a notification only bit with inadequate information in the preview.":::

</details>
<br>

<details><summary>Message extensions</summary>

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Apps that consist of search-based message extension provide user value by sharing cards that allow for contextual conversations without context switching.

To pass validation for a search-based message extension only app, the following are required as baseline to ensure that the user experience isn't broken. A card shared via a message extension provides value in Teams if:

1. Posted card provides adequate details requiring no further user action.
1. Posted card provides adequate preview information for a user to take action or decide to view further details in a link opening outside Teams.

</details>
<br>

<details><summary>Link unfurling </summary>

Link unfurling only apps don't provide significant value within Teams. Consider building more workflows in your app, if your app only supports link unfurling and has no other functionality.

### App Name

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with Microsoft [commercial certification policy number 1140.1.1](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114011-app-name) and provides more guidance to developers on naming their apps.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

An app's name plays a critical role in how users discover it in the Teams Store. Use the following guidelines to name an app:

* The name must include terms relevant to your users. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Prefix or suffix common nouns with the developer's name. For example, **Contoso Tasks** instead of **Tasks**. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Must not use **Teams** or other Microsoft product names such as Excel, PowerPoint, Word, OneDrive, SharePoint, OneNote, Azure, Surface, and Xbox that could falsely indicate co-branding or co-selling. For more information about referencing Microsoft software products and services, see [Microsoft Trademark and Brand Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks/usage/general). [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Must not copy the name of an app listed in the Teams Store or other offer in the commercial marketplace. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Must not contain profane or derogatory terms. The name also mustn't include racially or culturally insensitive language. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Must be unique. If your app (Contoso) is listed in the Teams Store and Microsoft AppSource and you want to list another app specific to a geography such as Contoso Mexico, your submission must meet the following criteria:
  * Call out the app's region-specific functionality in the title, metadata, first response app experience, and help sections. For example, title must be Contoso Mexico. App title must clearly differentiate an existing app from the same developer to avoid end-user confusion. [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * When uploading the app package in Partner Center, select the right **Markets** where the app is available in the **Availability** section. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App name mustn't lead with a core Teams feature such as Chat, Contacts, Calendar, Calls, Files, Activity, Teams, and Help. The app name doesn't shortens to either Chat, Contacts, Calendar, Calls, Files, Activity, Teams, and Help on install in the left navigation. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app is part of an official partnership with Microsoft, the name of your app must come first. For example, **Contoso connector for Microsoft Teams**.

* The app name mustn't have any reference to Microsoft or Microsoft products. Don’t use **Teams** or **Microsoft**, in the app name unless your app is in official partnership with Microsoft. In such an instance, the app name must come first before any reference to Microsoft. For example, **Contoso connector for Microsoft Teams**. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Don’t use parenthesis in naming to include Microsoft products. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Developer name must be the same in the app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) and AppSource. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App manifests submitted must be production manifests. Accordingly, app name mustn't indicate that the app is a preproduction app. For example, app name mustn't contain words such as Beta, Dev, Preview, and UAT. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The app name in the app manifest and AppSource must match. [*Mandatory Fix*]

 > [!TIP]
 > Your app’s branding on the Teams Store and AppSource including your app name, developer name, app icon, AppSource screenshots, video, short description, and website either separately or taken together mustn't impersonate an official Microsoft offering unless your app is an official Microsoft 1P offering.

</details>

### Duplicate App

* Apps from the same developer offering the same functionality must share an app listing unless privacy compliance requirements mandate separate app listings or separate app listing are required to support government cloud. You must build into your business logic and publish only one listing. [*Mandatory Fix*]

  * To fulfill multiple regions support requirement, you must build into your business logic and publish only one listing.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-pass-region-app-manifest.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the passed scenario of region requirement done with logic.":::

  * To fulfill multiple end-point requirements for on-premises and on-cloud deployment, you must build into your business logic and publish only one listing.

### Suitable for workplace consumption

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with Microsoft commercial certification policy number [1140.1.2](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114012-workplace-appropriateness), [100.8](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1008-significant-value), and [100.10](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10010-inappropriate-content) and provides additional guidance to developers on building workplace appropriate apps.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

App content must be suitable for general workplace consumption and follow all restrictions listed in the commercial marketplace certification policies. Content related to religion, politics, gambling, and prolonged entertainment is prohibited. [Mandatory Fix]

Your app must enable group collaboration, improve an individual's productivity, or both. Apps intended for team bonding and socializing must be collaborative and designed for multiple participants. The apps mustn't require a substantial time investment of over 60 mins per session or affect productivity. [Mandatory Fix]

Content aggregator apps must have a mechanism for users to report an issue or inappropriate content to the app publisher. [Mandatory Fix]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-content-aggregator-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the passed scenario of content aggregator app to report issues.":::

</details>

### Similar platforms and services

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.1.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114013-other-platforms-and-services).

Apps must focus on the Teams experience and not include the names, icons, or imagery of other similar chat-based collaboration platforms or services within the app content or in the app’s metadata unless the app provides specific interoperability.

### Feature names

App feature names in buttons and other UI text mustn't use terminology reserved for Teams and other Microsoft products. For example, **Start meeting**, **Make call**, or **Start chat** are feature names in use by Microsoft in Microsoft Teams. If necessary, include your app name to make the distinction clear, such as **Start Contoso meeting**.

### Authentication

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.1.4](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114014-access-to-services) and provides guidance to developers on authenticating their apps with external services.

For more information on how to implement app authentication, see [authentication in Teams](~/concepts/authentication/authentication.md).
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

#### Authenticating with external services

If your app authenticates users with an external service, follow these guidelines:

* **Sign in, sign out, and sign up experiences**:
  * Apps that depend on external accounts or services must provide clear and simple sign in, sign out, and sign up experience. [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * When users sign out, they must sign out only from the app and remain signed in to Teams. [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * Apps that depend on external accounts or services must provide a way forward for new users to sign up or contact the app publisher to learn more about the services and get access to the services.
  Way forward must be available in the app’s manifest, AppSource long description, and app first run experience (bot welcome message, tab setup, or config page). [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * Apps that require tenant admin to complete one-time setup must call out dependency on tenant admin to configure the app (before any other tenant user can install and use the app).
  Dependency must be called out in the app’s manifest, AppSource long description, all first run experience touchpoints (bot welcome message, tab setup, or config page), help text as considered necessary as part of bot response, compose extensions, or static tab content. [*Mandatory Fix*]
  
* **Content sharing experiences**: Apps that require authentication with an external service to share content in Teams channels must clearly state in the help documentation (or similar resources) on how to disconnect or unshare content if that feature is supported on the external service. This doesn't mean the ability to unshare content must be present in your Teams app.

</details>

### Audio

* If the primary intent of the app is to listen to music, it must support at least one collaborative scope with end-to-end workflow specific to app. For example, sharing of playlist, configuring or pinning playlist, and synchronously listening to music. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Apps published with the primary intent of letting users listen to music in Teams are recommended to include collaborative co-listening experience. [*Suggested Fix*]

## Security

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11403-security).

[Back to top](#teams-store-validation-guidelines)

### Financial information

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial certification policy number 1140.3.1](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114031-financial-transactions) and provides guidance on transmission of financial information within the Teams interface and notifies developers of restricted payment scenarios on the mobile (Android and iOS) version of their Teams app.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Apps mustn't ask users to make payments within the Teams interface and transmit financial information to users through a bot interface. [*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-financial-information-1.png" alt-text="validation-financial-info":::

You may provide link to secure external payment services only if you disclose it in your terms of use, privacy policy, profile page, or website before the user agrees to use the app. [*Mandatory Fix*]

Don't facilitate payments through an app for goods or services prohibited by [General policy number 100.10 Inappropriate content](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10010-inappropriate-content). [*Mandatory Fix*]

Apps running on the iOS or Android version of Teams must adhere to the following guidelines:

* Apps mustn't include in-app purchases, trial offers, or UI that aims to upsell users to paid versions or online stores to purchase other content, apps, or add-ins. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-financial-information-in-app-purchase.png" alt-text="validation-financial-info-in-app-purchase":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-financial-information-online-stores.png" alt-text="validation-online-store":::

* If your app requires an account, users can sign up for an account at no charge. The use of the term **free** or **free account** is prohibited. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* You can determine whether an account is active indefinitely or for a limited time. When the account expires the app mustn't show UI, text, or links indicating the need to pay. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Your app's privacy policy and terms of use must be free of any commerce-related UI or links. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>

### Bots

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.3.2](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114032-bots-and-messaging-extension).
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

For apps that use the Microsoft Azure Bot Service (such as bots and message extensions), you must follow all requirements defined in the Microsoft [Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=46).

Bots must always ask permission to upload a file and display a confirmation message.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-confirmation-message.png" alt-text="validation-bot-confirmation":::

</details>

### External domains

[*Mandatory Fix*]

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.3.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114033-external-domains) and provides developer guidance on usage of restricted domains in the `validDomains` app manifest property.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Don't include domains outside of your organization's control (including wildcards) and tunneling services in your app's domain configurations. The following exceptions include:

* If your app relies on SharePoint, you can include the associated root SharePoint site as a valid domain using the `{teamSiteDomain}` context property. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Don't use top level domains such as **.com**, **.in**, and **.org** as a valid domain. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Don't use **.onmicrosoft.com or** as a valid domain where **onmicrosoft** isn't under your control. However, you can use **yoursite.com** as a valid domain where **yoursite** is under your control even though the domain includes a wildcard. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app is a PowerApp built on the Microsoft Power Platform, you must include *apps.powerapps.com* as a valid domain to enable your app to be accessible and functional within Teams.

* External domains declared for your submission must not contain URLs. For example, www or https. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app uses the Azure Bot Service's OAuthCard, you must include *token.botframework.com* as a valid domain or else the Sign in button won't work. You mustn't declare *.botframework.com* as wildcards aren't allowed with this domain name. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* OpenAPI URLs must be under partner control.

* Following External Domains aren't allowed: [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * *.azurewebsites.net
  * *.azureedge.com
  * *.microsoft.com
  * *.microsoftonline.com
  * *.onmicrosoft.com
  * go.microsoft.com
  * teams.microsoft.com

When using wildcards (`*`), the following rules apply:

* If a subdomain segment includes a wildcard, it must be the only character in the segment.
* Any segment preceding a wildcard segment must also be a wildcard segment.

For example, *\*.\*.domain.com* is valid, but *foo.\*.myteam.domain.com* isn't valid.

</details>

### Sensitive content

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Your app mustn't post sensitive data, such as credit card, financial payment details, health, contact tracing, or other personally identifiable information (PII) to an audience not intended to view the content.

App must warn users before downloading any files or executables (.exe) into the user's machine or environment.

## General functionality and performance

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11404-functionality).

* Way forward guidance is mandatory for both admin and existing users. You can add way forward guidance as hyperlinks to sign up, get started, contact us, help links, or email.
* Calling out account dependency or limitations under app functionality isn't required but is mandatory to add it in both app manifest long description and AppSource app listing.
* You must call out any dependency on tenant admins for new users. If there's no dependency, it's mandatory to provide a sign up, contact us, get started link, or email.

[Back to top](#teams-store-validation-guidelines)

### Launching external functionality

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Apps mustn't take users out of Teams for core user scenarios. App content and interactions must occur within Teams capabilities, such as bots, Adaptive Cards, tabs, and dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x).

> [!NOTE]
> To redirect users from your Teams app to its native experience through a deep link with a protocol such as `tel:`, `mailto:`, or `webex:`, launch the deep link in a new window by calling the `window.open` method or using an anchor tag with `target="_blank"`.
<br>
</br>

<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

* Link users within Teams app and not to an external site or app. For scenarios that require external functionality, your app must take explicit user permission to launch the functionality. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Button UI text that launches external functionality must include content to indicate the user is taken out of the Teams instance. For example, include text such as **This way to Contoso.com** or **View in Contoso.com**. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Add **Pop-out** icon to let the users know that they're being navigated outside Teams. You can use the pop-out icon :::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/pop-out-icon.png" ::: to the right of the link. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If you're unable to add a **Pop-out** icon, you can implement any of the following options to let the user know that they're being navigated outside Teams: [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * Add a note in Adaptive Card that states that when users select **Get Help using this app**, it takes the user outside Teams.
  * Add interstitials dialogs.

</details>

### Compatibility

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Apps must be fully functional on the latest versions of the following operating systems and browsers:

* Microsoft Windows
* macOS
* Microsoft Edge
* Google Chrome
* iOS
* Android

Your app must show a graceful failure message on unsupported browsers and operating systems.

### Response time

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Teams apps must respond within a reasonable time-frame or show a loading or typing indicator or message or warning.

* Tabs must respond within two seconds or display a loading message or warning. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Bots must respond to user commands within two seconds or display a typing indicator. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Message extensions must respond to user commands within two seconds. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Notifications must display within two seconds of the user action. [*Mandatory Fix*]

### Apps powered by Artificial Intelligence

Explore resources designed to help you with responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) practices at every stage of innovation such as [Microsoft RAI Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai-resources) and [HAX Toolkit Project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/hax-toolkit/).

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy for Apps with AI generated content](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1-apps-with-artificial-intelligenceai-generated-content-must-meet-below-requirements) and [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy for Apps using facial recognition capabilities.](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#2-apps-using-facial-recognition-capabilities-are-subject-to-the-following-policies)

#### Apps with AI-generated content

* App must not generate, contain, or provide access to inappropriate, harmful, or offensive AI generated content consistent with existing commercial marketplace policies outlined in [100.10](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10010-inappropriate-content). [*Mandatory Fix*]

  * Consider using any of the following:
    * Use [Teams AI library](~/bots/how-to/Teams%20conversational%20AI/teams-conversation-ai-overview.md), Teams-centric interface to GPT-based common language models and user intent engines. [*Suggested Fix*]
    * Use of moderation hooks, which can be used to regulate bot responses through moderation API. [*Suggested Fix*]
    * Add conversation sweeping capability, which helps you monitor conversations and intervene when conversations go astray. [*Suggested Fix*]

* App must provide mechanisms for app users to report inappropriate, harmful, or offensive content to the developer by any of the following mechanisms: [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * App description including mail ID or link to the portal to log the issue.
  * In app mechanism to log issue along with specific reference to the inappropriate content.

* You must take timely action on reported concerns. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* App must clearly describe AI functionality before the customer acquires the offer consistent with policy [100.1.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#10013-description) and prompt user to review the info as a part of in-app functionality. [*Mandatory Fix*].

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/teams-ai-library-description-guideline.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the description for Ai functionality.":::

#### Apps using facial recognition capabilities

> [!NOTE]
> Apps in this category may undergo additional review for adherence to Microsoft’s Responsible AI principles.

* App must not allow use of facial recognition capabilities to identify an individual to be used by or for a police department in the United States. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* For apps utilizing facial recognition or emotional inference technologies, you must provide a prominent tag or indication of each of these capabilities in the app description. [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * Apps that use facial expressions or facial movements to infer emotional states, such as anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, or other terms commonly used to describe the emotional state of a person can be restricted based on the review.
  * Use of facial expressions and movements to detect and classify only individual facial elements, such as smiles or raised eyebrows is permitted. The key distinction is between the detection of facial expressions or movements as visual signals versus the inference of an emotional state.

## App package and Teams Store listing

[*Mandatory Fix*]

App packages must be correctly formatted and include all required information and components.

> [!TIP]
>
> * You must ensure the provided test accounts or test environment is valid in perpetuity, that is till the app is live on the commercial marketplace.
> * You must include the following detailed testing instructions for validating your app submission:
>
>   * **Steps to configure the app test accounts** in case app depends on external accounts for authentication.
>   * Summary of **expected app behavior** for the core workflows within Teams.
>   * **Clearly describe limitations**, conditions, or exceptions to the functionality, features, and deliverables in the app long description and related materials.
>   * **Emphasis on any considerations** for testers while validating your app submission.
>   * **Prepopulate the test accounts with dummy data** to aid testing.
>   * If you are providing your test accounts, ensure that you enable third-party integration. Also, disable two-factor or multi-factor authentication.

[Back to top](#teams-store-validation-guidelines)

### App manifest

[*Mandatory Fix*]

The app manifest defines your app's configuration.

* Your app manifest must conform to a publicly released app manifest schema. For more information, see [app manifest reference](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md). Don't submit your app using a preview version of the app manifest.
* If your app includes a bot or message extension, details in the app manifest must be consistent with Bot Framework metadata including bot name, logo, privacy policy link, and terms of service link.
* If your app uses Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, include the Microsoft Entra Application (client) ID in the app manifest. For more information, see the [app manifest reference](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#webapplicationinfo).

### Uses of latest app manifest schema

* If your app uses Single sign-on (SSO), you must declare Microsoft Entra ID in the app manifest for user authentication. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must use a publicly released app manifest schema. You can update your app package to use a public version of app manifest schema 1.10 or later. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* When you submit an app update, only increase the app version number. App ID of the updated app must match the App ID of the published app. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The presence of additional files within the app package isn't acceptable. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The version number must be the same in the app manifest file schema and additional languages app manifest schema. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must use the app manifest schema version 1.5 or later to localize your app. To use the app schema version 1.5 or later in your manifest.json file, update the `$schema` attribute to 1.5 or later. Update the `manifestVersion` property to `$schema` version (1.5 in this case). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* When you add, update, or remove an existing capability, add or remove app manifest or Partner Center metadata, you must increase the app version number and submit the new app manifest in your Partner Center account for validation. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The version string must follow the Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app requires admins to review permissions and grant consent in Teams admin center, you must declare `webapplicationinfo` in the app manifest. If `webapplicationinfo` isn't declared in the app manifest, the **Permissions** page for your app in Teams admin center is shown as **...** [*Mandatory Fix*]

* As part of Teams app certification, you must submit a production version of the app manifest. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* We recommend that you declare the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) ID in the app manifest. The MPN ID helps identify the partner organization that builds the app. [*Suggested Fix*]

* Scopes and/or context declared in app manifest must be visible within the app. [*Mandatory Fix*]

### App icons

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Icons are one of the main elements people see when browsing the Teams Store.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Your icons must communicate your app's brand and purpose while adhering to the following requirements:

* App's color and outline icon submitted in the app listing must match. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* The marketplace icon uploaded as part of the app's marketplace listing in your Partner Center account must match the color icon provided in your app package. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* The color version of your icon must be 192x192 pixels. Your icon symbol can be any color or colors, but it must sit on a solid or fully transparent square background. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* The outline version of your icon is displayed in the following scenarios:
  * When your app is in use and **hosted** on the app bar on the left side of Teams.
  * When a user pins your app's message extension.

* The outline must be 32x32 pixels and can be white with a transparent background or transparent with a white background. The icon mustn't have any extra padding around the symbol. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Your app package must include correctly sized and formatted icons. The icons must match the information in Teams Store listing metadata. [*Mandatory Fix*]

For more information, see [icon guidelines](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md#app-icons).

</details>

### App descriptions

You must have a short and long description for your app. App description helps improve your app discoverability in the Teams Store. The descriptions in your app configuration and Partner Center must be the same.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-adequete-information.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of adequate app description in the Teams app.":::

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-inadequete.png" alt-text="Graphic shows a failed scenario for an inadequate app description.":::

<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Descriptions mustn't directly or through suggestion derogate another brand (Microsoft owned or otherwise). Ensure that your description doesn’t include claims that can’t be substantiated. For example, Guaranteed 200 percent increase in efficiency.

* App description mustn't contain comparative marketing information. For example, don't use competitor logos or trademarks in the offer listing including tags or other metadata that references competing offers or marketplaces. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-comparitive-marketing-fail.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of comparative marketing information in app description.":::

* Hyperlink contact details, get started, help, or sign up in app description. [*Suggested Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-contact-deatils-hyperlinked.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of contact details hyperlinked in the app descriptions.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-contact-deatils-not-hyperlinked.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of contact details not hyperlinked in the app descriptions.":::

* App description must identify the intended audience, briefly and clearly explain its unique and distinct value, identify supported Microsoft products and other software, and include any prerequisites or requirements for its use. You must clearly describe any limitations, conditions, or exceptions to the functionality, features, and deliverables as described in the listing and related materials before the customer acquires your offer. The capabilities you declare must relate to the core functions and description of your offer. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If you update your app name, replace the old app name with new app name in the offer metadata in the app manifest, AppSource, and wherever applicable. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Limitations and account dependencies must be called out in the manifest App Description, AppSource, and Partner Center. For example:
  * Enterprise account
  * Paid subscription
  * Another license or account
  * Language
  * Public switched telephone network (PSTN) dialing
  * Regional dependency
  * Lead time for booking translators or live agents
  * Role based functionality
  * Dependency on native app

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-limitations-not-calledout-fail.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of limitations not called out in app descriptions.":::

* If your app is supported for specific regions or geographical locations, you must call out that specific region dependency in the app description in app manifest, Partner Center, and AppSource for that offer.

* If you need to reference Teams, write the first reference in the app listing as Microsoft Teams. Later references can be shortened to Teams. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-teams-reference-pass.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of correct reference to Teams in app description.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-teams-reference-fail.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of incorrect reference to Teams in app description.":::

#### Short description

A short description must be a concise summary of your app that highlights its value proposition and is directed at your target audience.

**Dos:**

* Keep the short description to one sentence.
* Put the most important information first.
* Include keywords that customers are likely to search for.
* Make efficient use of the available character limit. For example, don't repeat your app name.

**Don't:**

[*Suggested Fix*]

Use the word **app** in the short description.

#### Long description

The long description must provide an engaging narrative that highlights your app's value proposition, primary audience, and target industry. While the description can be as long as 4,000 characters, we recommended you to have a concise description of around 1000 characters.

**Dos:**

* Use [Markdown](https://support.office.com/article/use-markdown-formatting-in-teams-4d10bd65-55e2-4b2d-a1f3-2bebdcd2c772) to format your description.

* Use active voice and speak to users directly. For example, **You can ...**.

* List the key benefits to highlight the advantages of using your app. Add up to three benefits.

* Add the key value proposition of your app in Teams.

* List features with bullet points so it's easier to scan the description.

* Clearly describe limitations, features, conditions or exceptions to the functionality, and deliverables in the listing and related materials before the user installs your app. The Teams capabilities must relate to the core functions described in the listing.

* Ensure that the app description matches with the functionality available inside Teams app. Any reference to workflows outside the Teams app must be limited and distinctly called out from the Teams app functionality.

* Include a help or support link.

* Refer to **Microsoft 365** instead of **Office 365**.

* Use the following language when describing how the app works with Teams (or Microsoft 365):
  * **... works with Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... working with Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... within Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... for Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... integrated with Microsoft Teams.**
  * **... built for...**
  * **... developed for...**
  * **.. designed for...**

**Don'ts:**

[*Mandatory Fix*]

* Exceed 500 words.
* Abbreviate **Microsoft** as **MS** or **MSFT**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-microsoft-abbreviated.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of abbreviating Microsoft as MS or MSFT  for the first time in app description.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-microsoft-not-abbreviated.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of not abbreviating Microsoft as MS or MSFT for the first time in app description.":::

* Indicate the app is an offering from Microsoft, including using Microsoft slogans or taglines.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-offering-from-microsoft.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of how not to indicate Microsoft offering in app description.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-no-offering-indication-from-microsoft.png" alt-text="Graphic that shows an example of how to write app description without using microsoft slogans and taglines.":::

* Use the following language unless you're a certified Microsoft partner:
  * **... certified for ...**
  * **... powered by ...**
* Include typos, grammatical errors.
* Unnecessarily capitalize the entire app manifest or AppSource long description or app content.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-long-description-typos-pass.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of app long description without errors.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-long-description-typos-fail.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of app long description with typos and errors.":::

* Include links to AppSource.

  :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-app-description-link-to-appsource.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a fail scenario with links to AppSource in app long description.":::

* Make unverified claims. For example, best, top, and ranked, unless it comes with the source of the claim.
* Compare your offer with other marketplace offers.

For guidance on how to create an accurate, concise, and informative short and long description, see [checklist to write app descriptions](submission-checklist.md#write-descriptions).

### Screenshots

Screenshots provide a prominent visual preview of your app to complement your app name, icon, and descriptions.

<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Remember the following:

* You can have up to five screenshots per listing.
* Supported file types include PNG, JPEG, and GIF.
* Dimensions must be 1366x768 pixels.
* Maximum size of 1,024 KB.

**Dos:**

* Focus on your app's capabilities. For example, how people can communicate with your bot.
* Include content that accurately represents your app.
* Use text judiciously.
* Frame screenshots with a color that reflects your brand and include marketing content.
* Use high-resolution screenshots that are sharp and contain legible and clearly readable text. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* At least one screenshot must depict your app’s functionality on mobile devices. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-pass-app-functionality-mobile.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the passed scenario of app functionality on mobile devices.":::

* You can have up to five screenshots per listing. You must have a minimum of three and maximum five screenshots in your app listing. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Use mockups that accurately depict the app’s actual UI for the benefit of end-users. Screenshots must accurately depict the app’s actual UI or scenarios relevant to and related to the app. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-fail-suppliement-screenshot.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the failed scenario of supplement content used in screenshot.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-fail-actual-UI.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the failed scenario of screenshot of app's actual UI.":::

* Must depict app functionality or integration with Teams. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-fail-app-functionality.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the failed scenario of app functionality or integration.":::

* Provided screenshots mustn't incorrectly reference Microsoft Teams as MS, MSFT, or MS Teams. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your Teams app is extensible across Microsoft 365 clients (Microsoft 365, Outlook, and Microsoft Teams), the screenshots provided must depict the app functionality in other Microsoft 365 clients. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-pass-app-functionality-MS-365.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the passed scenario of Teams app functionality in MS 365 clients.":::

* You must provide captions in your screenshots to let the user clearly understand the app capability. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-pass-app-functionality.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the passed scenario of user attention for app functionality.":::

* If your app supports Tabs as a capability, the screenshots showcasing the app in the context of a Teams tab, in app listing, must contain Team’s chrome. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guildelines-pass-tabs-capability.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the passed scenario of screenshot of tab capability.":::

**Don'ts:**

* Include mockups that inaccurately reflect your app's actual UI, such as showing your app being used outside Teams.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-guidelines-fail-app-functionality-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the failed scenario of unrelated app functionality in Teams.":::

</details>

### Videos

A video in your app listing is one of the most effective ways to communicate why people must use your app. You can add your YouTube or Vimeo video URL that provides the value of your app. Also, as a best practice, we recommended that you add a video that provides the demo or scenario walkthrough of your app. [*Suggested fix*]

If you choose to submit a video as part of your app listing in your Partner Center account, ensure that you meet the following criteria:

* The video must be short, clear, engaging, and of good quality.
* The video must demonstrate how to set up and use the app.
* The video must be in a narrative form.
* The duration of the video must be within 60-90 seconds for a value video and the recommended duration for a walkthrough video is 3-5 minutes. [*Suggested Fix*]
* You must turn off advertisements from your YouTube or Vimeo account settings before submitting the video link in the app listing. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* The video must highlight your app’s functionalities and integration within Teams. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* The video must be available as a functional link. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* The video must be in the format `https://www.example.com/123456789`.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/video-app-listing-partner-center.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the failed scenario of video submitted as part of app listing in partner center.":::

* The video can be surfaced in the first position of the screenshots or videos carousel in the app details (Teams Store and Admin Center) and AppSource pages. [*Suggested Fix*]
* The video on demo or scenario walkthrough must intend to educate users and not to promote your app.

For more information on the criteria for creating an app value video or walkthrough video, see the [checklist to create a video](submission-checklist.md#create-a-video).

<br></br>

### Privacy policy

[*Mandatory Fix*]

The privacy policy can be specific to your Teams app or an overall policy for all your services.

* If you use a generic privacy policy template, you must add a reference to services, applications, or platforms in the scope of your privacy policy. You don’t need to specify your Teams app in the scope, if you include a reference to services, applications, and platforms. The app validation process interprets these references to include your Teams app along with your other services or websites.
* Must include how you handle user data storage, retention, and deletion. You must describe the security controls for data protection.
* Must include your contact information.
* Must not include URLs that are broken or for beta or staging purposes.
* Must not include links to AppSource.
* Must not require authentication to access privacy policy.
* Must not include any commerce UI or store links.
* Must have the same link in the app manifest and AppSource.

### Terms of use

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Use the following guidelines to write the Terms of use:

* Must be specific and applicable to your offering.
* Must be hosted on your own domain.
* Must have a secure (HTTPS) link.
* Access to Terms of use must not require authentication.
* Must have the same link in the app manifest and AppSource.

### Support links

[*Mandatory Fix*]

Your app's support URLs mustn't require authentication. For example, users must be allowed to contact you without sign in.
<br></br>
<details><summary>Expand to know more</summary>

Support URLs must include your contact details or a way forward for users to raise a support ticket. For example, if your support URL is hosted on GitHub, the GitHub page must be under your ownership and must include your contact details or a way forward for users to raise a support ticket.

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-supportlinks-authentication.png" alt-text="validation-support-links-auth":::

</details>

### Localization

[*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app supports localization, your app package must include a file with language translations that display based on the Teams language setting. The file must conform to the Teams localization schema. For more information, see [Teams localization schema](~/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization.md). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App metadata content must be the same in `en-us` and other localization languages. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Supported languages must be displayed in the AppSource app description. For example, this app is available in X (X= localized language). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If the user's client settings don't match with any of your additional languages, the default language is used as the final fallback language. Update the `localizationInfo` property with the correct default language that your application supports. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Update the `localizationInfo` property with the correct default language your application supports or add localized content for app manifest and Partner Center long and short description. [*Mandatory Fix*]

## Apps linked to SaaS offer

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.5](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies?branch=pr-en-us-5673). If you're building a Teams app linked to a Software as a Service (SaaS) offer, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines.
<br></br>
<details><summary>General</summary>

* ISVs must support the ability for multiple users (Subscribers) in the same tenant to manage their own subscription and assign licenses to users in the tenant.
* The offer must meet all the [technical requirements](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/include-saas-offer) for Teams apps linked to a SaaS offer.
* The Teams apps linked to SaaS offer must meet all the requirements defined in [1000 Software as a Service (SaaS)](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#1000-software-as-a-service-saas).
* `subscriptionOffer` details mentioned in the app manifest file must be correct. In your app manifest, add or update node `subscriptionOffer` with value `publisherId.offerId`. For example, if your publisher ID is `contoso1234` and your offer ID is `offer01`, the value that you specify in your app manifest must be `contoso1234.offer01`.
* Linked SaaS offer to the Teams app must be live in AppSource and preview offers aren't accepted for Teams Store approval.

</details>

</br>
<details><summary>Offer metadata</summary>

* Offer metadata must match across the app manifest, the Teams app listing in AppSource, and the SaaS offer in AppSource.
* Teams app and SaaS offer must be from the same publisher or developer. The SaaS offer referenced in the app manifest must belong to the same publisher as the Teams app is submitted to the commercial marketplace.
* As your submitted offer is a Teams app linked to SaaS offer, you must select **Additional purchases** as **Yes, my product requires purchase of a service or offers additional in-app purchases​** in Partner Center product set-up section of your offer listing.
* Plan descriptions and pricing details must provide enough information for users to clearly understand the offer listings.
* Any limitations, dependencies on additional services, and exceptions to features offered must be accurately called out in plan descriptions.
* The Teams apps linked to SaaS offer are designed to support licenses assigned on a named, per-user basis. Sometimes, the SaaS offer is built with other method or has specialized purchase flows. You must clearly mention in the app metadata and subscription plan details about the method and purchase flows.
* SaaS offer must provide messages and guidance to all users in all applicable states of purchase flow.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>SaaS offer home page and license management</summary>

* Provide introduction to subscribers on how to use the product.
* Allow the subscriber to assign licenses.
* Provide different ways to engage with support for issues, such as FAQ, knowledge base, and email.
* Validate users to ensure that they don’t already have license assigned through another user.
* Notify users after license assignment.
* Guide users on how to add the app to Teams and get started through Teams chat bot or email.

* If a SaaS app uses [Microsoft license management](manage-third-party-apps-license.md), after the confirmation of the app subscription on the ISV's landing page, the user must be redirected to the Microsoft license management in Teams to avoid a dead-end and allow the user to manage licenses within Teams.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Usability and functionality</summary>

* After successful purchase and assignment of licenses, you must provide the following:
  * Access to users for subscribed plan features.
  * Value addition and significant benefits of subscription plan to users.
  * From your Teams app, provide link to the SaaS application home page for subscribers to manage the licenses in the future.

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Configure and test SaaS application</summary>

If setup of your app for testing purposes is complex, provide an end-to-end functional document, linked SaaS offer configuration steps, and instructions for license and user management as part of your *Notes for Certification*.

> [!TIP]
> You can add a video on how your app and license management works to assist the team for testing.

## Tabs

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4.2](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114042-tabs).
If your app includes a tab, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines.
> [!TIP]
> For more information on creating a high-quality app experience, see [Teams tab design guidelines](~/tabs/design/tabs.md).

</br>
<details><summary>Setup</summary>

* Tab setup **mustn't dead-end** a new user. Provide a message on how to complete the action or workflow. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-new-user.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of Tab with a dead-end on setup.":::

* The user mustn't leave the tab configuration experience inside Teams to create content outside Teams and then return to Teams to pin it. Tab configuration screen must explain the value of configuration and how to configure. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-profile-name.png" alt-text="validation-tabs-set-up-profile-name":::

* Tab configuration screen mustn't embed an entire website. Keep your configuration experience focused. For example, if you're building a project management app that lets users configure a project in a channel, keep the tab configuration screen focused on allowing the user to select a project from your app to configure in the channel. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-configuration-experience.png" alt-text="validation-tabs-setup-configuration-exp":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tabs-setup-configuration-screen.png" alt-text="validation-tabs-set-up-configuration-screen":::

* Apps that require users to input a URL while configuring a tab must:
  * Provide an appropriate way forward guidance for the user to acquire or generate the URL. [*Mandatory Fix*]
  * Check for URL that is relevant or appropriate to the app’s functionality as per the app description. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tab-configuration-way-forward-url-pass.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of tab configuration with a way forward for user to generate a URL.":::
  
    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-tab-configuration-way-forward-url-fail.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of tab configuration without a way forward for user to generate a URL.":::

* Hyperlink the contact us information in the configuration screen instead of plain text to help users to contact you for support requirements. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* For a seamless first run user experience, we recommend that you hyperlink your support URL or email in the configuration screen. [*Suggested Fix*]

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Views</summary>

* The sign in screen area mustn't use large logos. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-applogin.png" alt-text="validation-views-app-login":::

* Content can be simplified by breaking down across multiple tabs.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-multiple-tabs.png" alt-text="val-views-multiple-tabs":::

* Tabs shouldn't have a duplicate header. Remove duplicate logos from the I-frame since the tab framework already displays the app icon and name. [*Suggested Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-no-duplicate-header-logo.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a tab without duplicate headers and logos.":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-views-duplicate-header-logo.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of a tab with duplicate headers and logos.":::

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Navigation</summary>

The following are the navigation guidelines:

* Tabs mustn't provide navigation that conflicts with the primary Teams navigation. If you provide a left navigation in your tab, it mustn't include only icons or icons with stacked text. It mustn't be a collapsible rail with the option to see icons with stacked text (mimicking the Teams navigation bar). Include icons with in line text or only text or use hamburger menus instead of tab left rail. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   Design your app with [basic](~/concepts/design/design-teams-app-basic-ui-components.md) and [advanced](~\concepts\design\design-teams-app-advanced-ui-components.md) Fluent UI components.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-static-tab.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of navigation in a tab that doesn't conflict with the primary Teams navigation.":::

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-left-navigation.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of left navigation rail that conflicts with the primary Teams navigation.":::

* If your tab has a toolbar on the left rail without any navigation component, the toolbar must leave 20 pixels spacing from Teams left navigation. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-spacing-between-toolbar.png" alt-text="validation-nav-spacing-between-toolbar":::

* The secondary and tertiary pages in a tab must be opened in a level two (L2) and level three (L3) view in the main tab area, which is navigated via breadcrumbs or left navigation. You can also use the following components to aid navigation in a tab:
  * Back buttons
  * Page headers
  * Hamburger menus

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-in-meeting-improper-navigation-leveles.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example of in-meeting dialog with multiple navigation levels.":::

* Deep links in tabs mustn't link to an external webpage but within Teams. For example, dialogs or other tabs. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-view-button-not-linked-static-tab.png" alt-text="validation-nav-view-button-not-linked-static-tab":::

* Tabs mustn't allow users to navigate outside Teams for the core app experience. Tabs can redirect outside Teams for non-core workflows. For example, to raise a support ticket. [*Mandatory Fix*]

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-core-workflow-within-configuration.png" alt-text="validation-nav-core-workflow-within-configuration":::

    :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-navigation-core-workflow-redirects-outside.png" alt-text="validation-nav-core-workflow-redirects-outside":::

* Horizontal scroll mustn't be present in an in-meeting tab. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* In-meeting dialogs used in your app mustn't allow horizontal scrolling. Use in-meeting dialogs sparingly and for scenarios that are light and task oriented. You can specify the width of the in-meeting dialog’s I-frame within the supported size range to account for different scenarios. [*Mandatory Fix*]
* Dialogs used in your app mustn't allow horizontal scrolling. Dialogs allow you to select different sizes to make the content responsive without the need of Horizontal scroll. If necessary, you can use a Stageview (a full screen UI component to surface your web content) to complete the workflow without Horizontal scroll. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Horizontal scroll present in the tab in a personal chat, channel, and in-meeting details tab in any scope isn't allowed if the entire tab canvas is scrollable, unless your tab uses an infinite canvas with fixed UI elements. [*Mandatory Fix*]

## Bots

:::image type="icon" source="../../../../assets/icons/certificate-icon-16.png"::: This section is in line with [Microsoft commercial marketplace policy number 1140.4.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#114043-bots).

If your app includes a bot, ensure that it adheres to these guidelines.

> [!TIP]
> For more information on creating a high-quality app experience, see [Teams bot design guidelines](~/bots/design/bots.md).

</br>
<details><summary>Bot design guidelines</summary>

* Your Teams app must follow [Teams bot design guidelines](../../../../bots/design/bots.md).

* You must implement a dialog to avoid multi-turn bot response when the workflow involves the user performing repetitive tasks. For example, use a dialog to repetitively capture name, dob, place, and designation instead of using multi-turn conversations. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Any broken links, responses, or workflows in your app must be fixed. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>

</br>
<details><summary>Bot commands</summary>

Analyzing user input and predicting user intent is difficult. Bot commands provide users a set of words or phrases for your bot to understand.

* All commands that your bot supports must work correctly, including generic commands such as **Hi**, **Hello**, and **Help**. [*Mandatory Fix*]

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-commands-deadend.png" alt-text="validation-bot-commands-dead-end":::

* You must list at least one valid bot command in the `items.commands.title` section of the app manifest and add a suitable description that gives clarity to the user on the bot command and its usage. Bot commands listed in the `commandLists` section of the app manifest surface as prepopulated commands in the bot command menu and provide a way forward for the new user to interact with the bot. [*Suggested Fix*]

* Bot response mustn't contain any official Microsoft product images or avatars. Use your own assets in your app. Use of Microsoft product images in your app isn't allowed. You may only copy, modify, distribute, display, license, or sell Microsoft copyrighted product images if you're granted explicit permission within the End-User License Agreement (EULA), license terms that accompany the content, or in the [Microsoft Trademark and Brand guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/legal/intellectualproperty/trademarks). [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots must respond to user commands without displaying a continuous loading indicator. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bot help command response mustn't redirect the user outside Teams. Bot help command response can redirect user to a canvas within the Teams app or provide a way forward response in an Adaptive Card. [*Mandatory Fix*]

<details><summary>Bot welcome messages</summary>

* If the app has a complex configuration flow (requires an enterprise license or lacks an intuitive sign up flow), then bots in such apps must always send a welcome message during the first run.

  For best experience, the welcome message must include the value offered by the bot to users, who installed the bot in channel, how to configure the bot, and briefly describe all supported bot commands. You can display the welcome message using an Adaptive Card with buttons for better usability. For more information, see [how to trigger a bot welcome message](~/bots/how-to/conversations/send-proactive-messages.md). For apps without a complex configuration flow, you can choose to trigger a welcome message during the bot first run experience. However, if a welcome message is triggered, it must follow the welcome message guidelines.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/submission/validation-bot-no-welcome-message.png" alt-text="Graphic shows an example of bot not sending a welcome message when the bot has a complex configuration workflow.":::

* Bot welcome messages in channels and chats are optional during first run, especially if the bot is available for personal use and performs similar actions. Your bot mustn't send welcome messages to users individually (it's considered [spamming](#botmessagespamming)). The message must also mention the person who added the bot.

* Welcome message mustn't contain links to any app marketplace including AppSource. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your app has a complex configuration workflow that requires admin led installation, doesn't have an intuitive and readily available sign up flow, or requires users to complete configuration steps outside the Teams experience and return then the bot must send a proactive welcome message in a team or group chat scope after installation. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* If your bot sends a welcome message in the channel, it mustn't send it to users individually (It's considered spamming). The welcome message must also mention the person who added the bot. [*Suggested Fix*]

<details><summary><a id="botmessagespamming">Bot message spamming</a></summary>

Bots mustn't spam users by sending multiple messages in short duration.

* **Bot messages in channels and chats**: Don't spam users by creating separate posts. Create a single post with replies in the same thread. [*Mandatory Fix*]

<details><summary>Bots and Adaptive Cards</summary>

Adaptive Cards are a highly recommended way to display bot messages. The cards must be lightweight and only include up to six actions. To display more content, consider using a dialog or tab.

For more information about cards, see:

* [Designing Adaptive Cards](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/design-effective-cards.md)
* [Cards reference](~/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference.md#types-of-cards)

Bot experience must be fully responsive on mobile. Bot responses must provide a way forward where applicable. Bot musts be responsive and fail with a graceful error message for failures. Bot messages sent in the personal scope to user's base on triggers in a collaborative scope must provide contextual information (including the message’s origin).

</details>
</br>

<details><summary>Notification only bots</summary>

Apps that consist of notification only bots provide user value by triggering user notifications based on certain triggers or events in the core app or backend. For example, a new sales lead or prospect is added for the sales team to follow up on. A high-quality notification only bot notifies the users regularly on certain event completions such as workflow completions or alerts.

> [!TIP]
> Preview information and provide basic in line user actions in the posted card so that the user isn't required to navigate outside Teams for all actions (irrespective of complexity).

</details>
<br/>

<details><summary>Bot metadata information</summary>

* Bot information in the app manifest (bot name, logo, privacy link, and terms of service link) must be consistent with the Bot Framework metadata. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Ensure that the bot ID in the app manifest matches with bot ID in the last Teams Store published version of your app. Changing bot IDs in an app update leads to permanent loss of all user interaction history with the bot for existing users of your app and starts a new conversation chain with the new Bot ID. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Any change to app name, metadata, bot welcome message, or bot responses must be updated with new name. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App name in the bot welcome message or bot responses must match the app name in the app manifest. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</details>
<br/>

<details><summary>Bot in collaborative scope</summary>

* Bot installation in a channel or group chat scope to obtain the team roster for sending proactive notifications for users as 1:1 chats for team specific triggers isn't allowed. For example, app that pairs people for a meetup. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bot in a channel or a group chat only used to obtain the messages or posts for sending proactive notifications for users as 1:1 chats isn't allowed. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Bots installed in collaborative scope must provide a user value in the collaborative scope. [*Mandatory Fix*]

  * Allow users to share cards with other users based on the action taken. This is to ensure that apps don't take silent actions. For example, a ticket is created based on a message in a channel, but the app doesn't send a notification or doesn't provide a way to request the user to share ticket details after the ticket is created. [*Mandatory Fix*]

</br>
<details><summary>Meeting extension design guidelines</summary>

* Your Teams apps must follow [Meeting extension design guidelines](../../../../apps-in-teams-meetings/design/designing-apps-in-meetings.md).

* With the in-meeting app experience, you can engage participants during the meeting by using in-meeting tabs, dialog box, and the in-meeting share to stage feature. If your app supports Teams meeting extension, you must provide a responsive in-meeting experience aligned with the Teams meeting experience. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Meeting extensibility apps must offer a responsive in-meeting experience aligned to the Teams meeting experience. In-meeting experience is mandatory for a Teams app that supports meeting extensibility but, pre- and post-meeting experiences aren't mandatory. [*Mandatory Fix*]

  * With the pre-meeting app experience, users can find and add meeting apps. Users can also perform pre-meeting tasks such as developing a poll to survey the meeting participants. If your app provides a pre-meeting experience, it must be relevant to the workflow of the meeting.

  * With the post-meeting app experience, users can view the results of the meeting such as, poll survey results or feedback and other app content. If your app provides a post-meeting experience, it must be relevant to the workflow of the meeting.

  * With the in-meeting app experience, you can engage meeting participants during the meeting and enhance the meeting experience for all the attendees. Attendees mustn't be taken outside the Teams meeting for completing core user workflows of your app.

* The meeting canvas’ header must display the correct app name to avoid confusing the meeting attendee. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* You must include an option for the user to sign out or log out from the meeting extension. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Meeting tabs on mobile platforms must include relevant workflows. Blank pages mustn't be present in a meeting tab. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* Meeting stage is a focused, intuitive, and collaborative participation canvas. Meeting stage mustn't embed the complete website experience. [*Mandatory Fix*]

* App mustn't show continuous loading screen, error, or broken functionality that dead-ends the user or blocks completion of a workflow in a meeting scenario. [*Mandatory Fix*]

# App detail page checklist 
Make sure your app descriptions and screenshots follows our [AppSource guidance for creating an effective store listing](/office/dev/store/create-effective-office-store-listings) and [Screenshots requirement](#create-effective-screenshots)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you copy over the description you write in AppScource onto the manifest. Teams will only use the description you provided in the manifest.

## Create effective screenshots

The screenshots uploaded on the Seller Dashboard are displayed in both [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps?product=office%3Bteams&page=1) and your app listing in the Teams client to provide a visual preview of your app along with your app description.

You can provide 1 to 5 screenshots. They can be .png, .jpg, or .gif files, and should be 1366x768 pixels, with a max size of 1024 KB.

Screenshots submitted on the seller dashboard should:

* Focus on highlighting all of your app's capabilities
* Not show any chrome/UI from outside of your app; do not capture any Teams or browser UI in your screenshots.
* Content should be representative of the app; do not include mock-ups that do not accurately reflect your apps actual UI such as showing your website instead of your Teams tab
* Text should be well-populated without being excessive

You can surround your screenshots with a background color and add marketing content similar to the [Freshdesk](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104381505?src=office&tab=Overview) example. In that case the dimensions are not of the screenshot, they are of the overall image.

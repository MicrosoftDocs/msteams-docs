# Monetize your app

Microsoft Teams app Store provides features to monetize your app that help you accelerate your business and reach customers with best solutions. You can monetize your app by creating offers for your applications and expand your customer base through interactive user engagement.

Microsoft commercial marketplace hosts to publish offers through two main online store, Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. The offers for your applications and solutions are published in the store and made available for customers.

There are four ways you can monetize your app by choosing a suitable publishing option:

* **Get It Now**: Provide offers as subscriptions (transactable) or free app, or let your customer bring their own licenses (bring your own license).
* **Free Trail**: Allow to use app for free for a definite period based on the offer type.
* **Test Drive**: Allow to use the preconfigured environment for a fixed period.
* **Contact Me**: Allow the users to reach you for offer details and enquire of their needs.

The publishing option decides the way you want to engage with your customers and the purchase experience you want to provide.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start creating an offer, you must first decide the listing or publishing option. The listing options differ based on the offer type.

Let's get to know about monetizing your Software as a Service (SaaS) applications in Teams store and the features.

## SaaS offer

SaaS applications published in Microsoft commercial marketplace are SaaS offers. The availability of the offer in the online store is based on the industry it's built for and the related configurations done in the offer. As a publisher, create your marketplace offers in Partner Center and have them in either of the online stores.

> [!NOTE]
> To create and publish your offer, you must have a commercial marketplace account in Partner Center.

In this module, you learn about the entire process from planning the SaaS offer to publishing the app with the offer. Here are some features you can opt to integrate with your SaaS to enable better service and expand the customer base.

### Decide a publishing option

When you're creating an offer, you're asked if you want to sell through Microsoft or not. Based on your response, the published offer has the suitable call-to-action button on the offer listing page. The listing option you select also decides the technical requirements to create an offer. Let's learn in detail about it when you [plan your SaaS offer](include-saas-offer.md).

### In-app purchases

In-app purchase option allows the customers to upgrade from a free to a paid version of your app from within the app. Whether you charge a price for your app or offer it for free, you can use in-app purchases in your app to provide an ongoing revenue stream.

### Test drive

With a transactable Software as a Service (SaaS) offer, you can allow customers to test the end-to-end purchase experience for your monetized apps for a fixed time. Test drive and free trails are different, and you can offer one or both the features to the customers.

### Set up Microsoft license management

You can allow Microsoft to manage app licenses on your behalf or manage licenses yourself. If you select to use Microsoft license management to manage a SaaS license purchased in Teams, you can easily assign, unassign, use, and track SaaS licenses from the Teams store.

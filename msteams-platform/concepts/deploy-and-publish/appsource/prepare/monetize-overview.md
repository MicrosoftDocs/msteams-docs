# Monetize your Teams app

App monetization is an essential phase in the app development process, and Microsoft Teams Store provides a platform to monetize your app. You can create offers for your apps in Microsoft Partner Center and publish in Teams Store to reach customers with the best solutions. 

When published, they are available as software as a service (SaaS) offers for purchase from Microsoft commercial marketplace. If the SaaS offers are linked to Teams app, it can be purchased from Teams Store. Commercial marketplace also facilitates publishing offers through Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. 

## SaaS offer

SaaS offers play a crucial role for businesses aiming to leverage their apps to generate revenue. As a publisher, you can create your marketplace offers in Partner Center, link the offer to your app, and publish the SaaS app for purchase. Apps with SaaS offers that are published in Microsoft commercial marketplace as subscriptions are SaaS apps. 

The publishing options available in a SaaS offer by which you can drive app monetization are:

* **Subscription**: You can provide transactable offers that can be purchased. You can also provide a free app or allow your customers to bring their own licenses.

* **Free trial**: You can provide free access to your app for a limited time or functionality. This encourages users to purchase the full version after the trial period.

* **Test drive**: You can provide access to preconfigured environment for a fixed period and encourage users to purchase. Test drive and free trials are different, and you can provide one or both the features to the customers.

* **Contact me**: You can allow users to contact you for specific offers, unique requirements, and any enquiries.

Here are the other features associated with a SaaS offer:

* **In-app purchases**: Allow users to upgrade from a free to a paid version within the app. Whether your app is free or paid, [in-app purchases](in-app-purchase-flow.md) can generate an ongoing revenue stream. </br>

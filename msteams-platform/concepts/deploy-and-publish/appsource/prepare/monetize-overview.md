# Monetize your Teams app

App monetization is an essential phase in the app development process, and Microsoft Teams Store provides a platform to monetize your app. Apps published with subscriptions can be purchased from the Microsoft commercial marketplace that includes Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. To purchase from Teams Store, you can link the SaaS offers to a Teams app.

## SaaS offer

Software as a service (SaaS) offers play a crucial role for businesses aiming to leverage their apps to generate revenue. Apps with SaaS offers that are published in Microsoft commercial marketplace are SaaS apps. The publishing options available in a SaaS offer by which you can drive app monetization are:

:::image type="content" source="../../../../assets/images/saas-offer/monetize-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the monetization options.":::

* **Subscription**: You can provide transactable offers that can be purchased. You can also provide a free app or allow your customers to bring their own licenses.

* **Free trial**: You can provide free access to your app for a limited time or functionality. This encourages users to purchase the full version after the trial period.

* **Test drive**: You can provide access to preconfigured environment for a fixed period and encourage users to purchase. Test drive and free trials are different, and you can provide one or both the features to the customers.

* **Contact me**: You can allow users to contact you for specific offers, unique requirements, and any enquiries.

As a publisher, you can create your marketplace offers in Microsoft Partner Center. You can then link the offer to your app and publish the SaaS app for purchase.  

Here are few key features associated with a SaaS offer:

* **In-app purchases**: Allow users to upgrade from a free to a paid version within the app. Whether your app is free or paid, [in-app purchases](in-app-purchase-flow.md) can generate an ongoing revenue stream. </br>

* **Microsoft license management**: Enables Microsoft to track and manage app licenses on your behalf from the Teams Store. You can either allow Microsoft to manage licenses on your behalf or you can manage licenses on your own. For more information, see [configure your SaaS offer setup details](/partner-center/marketplace-offers/create-new-saas-offer).

### Private plans

Private plan provides customized solutions for targeted customers based on their organizational requirements. You can either use an existing offer or a new offer to create a private plan. For more information, see [private plans in commercial marketplace](/partner-center/marketplace/private-plans).

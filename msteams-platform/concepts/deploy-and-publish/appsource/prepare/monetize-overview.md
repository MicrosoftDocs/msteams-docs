# Monetize your Teams app

Monetizing your app is a crucial step in the app development process and Microsoft Teams Store provides a platform to monetize your app. You can create offers for your applications in Microsoft Partner Center and reach customers with the best solutions.

Microsoft commercial marketplace facilitates publishing offers through Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. The published offers are available for purchase from commercial marketplace. If the offers are linked to Teams app, it can be purchased from Teams Store.

There are four ways by which you can drive app monetization:

      * **Subscription**: You can provide transactable offers that can be purchased. You can also provide a free app or allow your customers to bring their own licenses.

      * **Free trial**: You can provide free access to your app for a limited time or with limited functionality. This encourages users to purchase the full version after the trial period.

* **Test drive**: You can provide access to preconfigured environment for a fixed period.

* **Contact me**: You can allow users to contact you for specific offers, unique requirements, and any enquires.

## SaaS offer

Software as a Service (SaaS) applications with subscriptions that are published in Microsoft commercial marketplace for purchase are SaaS offers. As a publisher, you can create your marketplace offers in Partner Center and publish for purchase.

> [!NOTE]
> To create and publish your offer, you must have a [commercial marketplace account in Partner Center](/partner-center/create-account).

When creating a SaaS offer, you must determine the publishing option, specifically, if you're selling through Microsoft or managing transaction independently. For more information on publishing options, see [plan for a SaaS offer](include-saas-offer.md).

Here are some features you can integrate with the SaaS offer:

* **In-app purchases**: Allow users to upgrade from a free to a paid version within the app. Whether your app is free or paid, in-app purchases can generate an ongoing revenue stream. </br>

* **Test drive**: Allow users to test the end-to-end purchase experience of your app for a fixed time. Test drive and free trials are different, and you can provide one or both the features to the customers.</br>

* **Microsoft license management**: Enable Microsoft to manage app licenses on your behalf that tracks and manages licenses from the Teams Store. For more information, see [Set up Microsoft license management](manage-third-party-apps-license.md#set-up-microsoft-license-management).

### Private plans

You can create a private plan for your SaaS offer to provide customized solutions for targeted customers based on their organizational requirements. You can either use an existing offer or a new offer to create a private plan. For more information, see [private plans in commercial marketplace](/partner-center/marketplace/private-plans).

Now that we know about the monetizing options and a SaaS offer, let's learn in detail on planning and publishing the SaaS offer for your app.

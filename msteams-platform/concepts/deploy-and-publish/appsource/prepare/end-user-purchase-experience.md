# Purchase and manage app subscriptions and licenses

Users can purchase subscriptions and manage licenses from Microsoft Teams Store for an individual, a team, or an organization. As a developer, you can enhance the user experience for your app purchases based on the content outlined here. This article helps you understand the user's app purchase experience in Teams Store and provide a similar experience.

## Subscription purchase experience

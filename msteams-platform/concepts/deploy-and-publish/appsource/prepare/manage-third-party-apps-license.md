# Set up Microsoft license management

Independent software vendors (ISVs) can configure Microsoft license management for third-party SaaS apps in Partner Center as part of the offer publishing. This allows Teams admins or users to easily assign, unassign, use, and track SaaS licenses for their third-party app subscriptions within Teams.

To enable license management for a third-party app in Teams, follow the steps:

1. [Create an offer in Partner Center](#create-an-offer-in-partner-center)
1. [Update your Teams app](#update-your-teams-app)
1. [Post purchase](#post-purchase)
1. [Integrate with Graph usageRights API](#integrate-with-graph-usagerights-api)

## Create an offer in Partner Center

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/) and select **Partner Center**.

## Update your Teams app

Update your Teams app to map to the paid functionality and [Map your Teams app](https://aka.ms/TMTG) to your offer and publish.

## Post purchase

1. After activation, customer is redirected from landing page to Teams License Management.

1. Upon successful completion of subscription purchase, the customer is redirected to the app landing page for subscription activation. This is the existing experience for user purchasing [Monetized apps in Teams](https://aka.ms/TMTG).

1. After the customer activates the subscription purchase on landing page, customer is redirected to subscriptions page in Teams via a [redirect URL](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/subscriptionManagement) link or button that the customer selects on the publisher landing page.

## Integrate with Graph usageRights API

Integrate with Graph usageRights API to manage user permissions at the time of app launch by a customer who has a purchase license. You're required to determine the user’s permissions for the app with a Graph call to the usageRights API.

You can call Graph APIs to determine if the currently logged in user with a valid subscription of the plan has access to your app. To call Graph usageRights API to check user permissions, follow the steps:

1. Get user OBO token: [Get access on behalf of a user](/graph/auth-v2-user).

1. Call Graph to get user’s object ID: [Use the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/use-the-api).

1. Call usageRights API to determine the user has License to the plan: [List user usageRights API](/graph/api/user-list-usagerights?view=graph-rest-beta&tabs=http&preserve-view=true).

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > * You need to have minimum `User.Read` permissions to call usageRights.
   > The usageRights API is currently in beta version. After the version is updated to V1, users must upgrade from beta to V1 version.
   > * If the Microsoft Entra app is used for both SaaS Fulfillment APIs and usageRights API, ensure that the tenant under which the Microsoft Entra app is created is either the publishing tenant or the associated tenant in the Partner Center.

To determine if the tenant for the Microsoft Entra app is part of the Partner Center setup, follow these steps:

1. Sign in  to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/) with the publisher account that is used to publish the SaaS offer.
1. On the upper-right corner, select the **Settings** icon.
1. Select **Account Settings**.
1. On the left pane, select **Tenants**.
   You can see all tenants associated with the Microsoft Partner Network (MPN) account. The tenant, who is the owner of the Microsoft Entra app, must be available in the list. If the tenant isn’t on the list, you can use the **Associate Azure ID** button to link the tenant.

## Check license usage in Partner Center analytics

1. Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/).
1. In the left pane, go to **Commercial Marketplace > Analyze > Licensing**.
1. Select **Plan and Tenant** in the reporting widget to see the month wise usage.

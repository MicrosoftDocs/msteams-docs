</details>

<details>

<summary><b>What is verified in the Partner Center account verification process?</b></summary>

There are three verification areas, **Email Ownership**, **Employment**, and **Business**. For more information, see [what is verified and how to respond](/partner-center/verification-responses#what-is-verified-and-how-to-respond).

If you're the primary contact, global admin, or account admin, you can monitor verification status and track progress on your profile page.

Once verification process is complete, the status of your enrollment on the profile page changes from *pending* to *authorized*. The primary contact then receives an email from Microsoft within a few business days.

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>My account verification status hasn't advanced beyond Email Ownership. How should I proceed?</b></summary>

During the **Email Ownership** verification process, a verification email is sent to the primary contact. Check your primary contact inbox for an email from **<maccount@microsoft.com>** with the subject line **Action needed: Verify your email account with Microsoft** and complete the email verification process. The verification email is sent to the address listed on your Partner Center account settings.

Remember the following about the email verification process:

* The email verification link is only valid for seven days.
* You can request to resend the email by visiting your partner profile page and selecting the **Resend verification email** link.
* To ensure you receive the email, safe-list **microsoft.com** as a secure domain and check your junk email folders.

<br>

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>I've checked my mail folders and haven't received the verification email. What must I do next?</b></summary>

Try the following:

* Check your junk or spam folder.
* Clear the browser cache, go to your Partner Center account dashboard, and select **Resend verification email**.
* Try accessing the **Resend verification email** link from a different browser.
* Work with your IT department to ensure that the verification emails are not blocked by your email server.
* Adjust your server's spam filter to allow or safe-list all emails from **<maccount@microsoft.com>**.

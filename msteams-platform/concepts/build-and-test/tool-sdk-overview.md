# Tools and SDKs

Build and develop your Microsoft Teams app using tools, SDKs, and libraries. Now, Microsoft provides a comprehensive platform to create, develop, test, debug, and publish your Teams app seamlessly, making the entire process efficient and streamlined. Teams offers the following platform:

* [Tools](#tools)
* [SDKs and libraries](#sdks-and-libraries)

## Tools

Teams platform brings you different tools to build and develop your Teams apps. The following tools are available to build your app:

| Tools | Why do you need? | Environment | Test and debug |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| [Teams Toolkit](../../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md) | Teams Toolkit makes it simple to get started with app development for Teams. You can begin with a project template for common custom app built for your org (LOB app) scenarios or start from a sample. Save time on setup through automated app registration and configuration using Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio. | **Visual Studio Code**: JavaScript and TypeScript </br> **Visual Studio**: .NET and Blazor | In Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio |
| [Yeoman generator for Teams](https://github.com/pnp/generator-teams) | Yeoman generator or YoTeams allows you to create Teams apps using TypeScript and JavaScript on your terms, in your preferred editor, and without any external or online dependencies. | TypeScript and JavaScript | NA |
| [Teams Toolkit CLI](../../toolkit/Teams-Toolkit-CLI.md) | TeamsFx CLI is a text-based command line interface (CLI) that accelerates Teams application development. It aims to provide keyboard centric experience when building Teams applications. | JavaScript and .NET | Use command prompt |
| [Developer Portal for Teams](teams-developer-portal.md) | Developer Portal for Teams is the primary tool for configuring, distributing, and managing your Teams apps. With Developer Portal, you can create a basic app manifest (previously known as Teams app manifest) and distribute the app to Teams.  | Supports all languages | Developer Portal for Teams |

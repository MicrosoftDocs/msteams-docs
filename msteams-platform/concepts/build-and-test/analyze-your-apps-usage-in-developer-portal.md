# Analyze app usage in Developer Portal

Developer Portal provides a comprehensive suite of tools to help you analyze and understand your app’s performance and user engagement. By using these analytics, you can gain valuable insights into how users interact with your app, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance the overall user experience.

Whether you’re tracking active users, retention rates, or usage patterns across different platforms, Developer Portal helps you with the information you need to optimize your app and ensure its success. Custom apps built for your org (LOB apps) can access app usage data only for Teams. However, for third-party apps you can explore new Microsoft 365 dimensions, such as host product and capabilities.

The app usage for a given day is reflected within 24 to 48 hours, and usage data for the new apps can take up to three to five days to reflect in the charts.

# [Custom apps built for your org (LOB apps)](#tab/custom-apps-built-for-your-org)

You can view your custom app's usage and other insights from the **Analytics** page. To access the page:

1. Go to **[Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com)**.
1. Select **Apps** from the left pane.
1. Select the required app from the **Apps** page.
1. Select **Analytics** under the **Overview** section or select **View details** under the **Active Users (Preview)** card.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tdp/dev-app-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the analytics page of your app in Developer Portal."lightbox="../../assets/images/tdp/dev-app-portal.png":::

| Metric | Definition |
| :-----------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Monthly R30 active users (MAU)** | The default usage metric. It shows the count of unique active users who used your app within that rolling 30 days window in UTC. |
| **Daily active users (DAU)** | It shows you the count of unique active users who used your app in a given day in UTC. |
| **Weekly R7** | It shows the count of unique active users who used your app within that rolling 7 days window in UTC. |

As you explore individual metrics on this page, you can use the **Filter** button to analyze your app's usage from the following filter options:

* **Aggregation type**: This filter allows you to group the metrics by a count of distinct users or a count of distinct tenants or customers.
* **Platform**
* **Operating system**
* **Area**

 :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tdp/dev-analytics-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the analytics page filter in Developer Portal.":::

After you have selected your desired filters, you can explore the following individual widgets:

* [Usage by time period](#usage-by-time-period)
* [Usage by platform and OS](#usage-by-platform-and-os)
* [Usage by retention state](#usage-by-retention-state)
* [Usage intensity](#usage-intensity)

 ### Usage by time period

  The **Usage by time period** chart shows you the number of active users or tenants who opened and used your app across different time periods.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tdp/usage-by-time-period.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows you the usage by time period chart for your published app.":::

 | Metric | Definition |
 | :-----------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | **Monthly R30** | Each data point represents a given R30 (Rolling 30 days) period. |
 | **Monthly R28** | Each data point represents a given R28 (Rolling 28 days) period. |

 ### Usage by platform and OS

  The **Usage by platform and OS** chart shows your app's active usage across various endpoints, such as **Windows**, **Mac**, **iOS**, **Android**, and **Web**. The same user or tenant can use an app on multiple endpoints. Each data point represents a given R30 (Rolling 30 days) period.

   | **DAU/MAU** | The ratio of the average number of unique users or tenants who used your app on each day divided by the Monthly active users for the selected R30 time period. |

 ### App dashboard

   The **My App dashboard** table shows you the latest R30 (Rolling 30 days) data for each of the metrics under the previous four categories, and the Month over Month change. Use the time picker on the upper right side and select the desired date to view the following:

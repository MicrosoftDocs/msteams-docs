# Prepare your Office 365 tenant

To develop apps for Microsoft Teams, you need to be an [Office 365 customer with one of the following plans](https://products.office.com/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans).

* Business Essentials
* Business Premium
* Enterprise E1, E3, and E5
* Developer
* Education, Education Plus, and Education E5

Microsoft Teams will also be available to customers who purchased E4 prior to its retirement.

## Just need a development environment?

If you don't currently have an Office 365 account, you can sign up for the [Office 365 Developer program](https://dev.office.com/devprogram) to get a *free* 90 days (can be renewed for as long as you're using it for development activity) Office 365 Developer Tenant. If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional subscription, sign up using your [Visual Studio benefits](https://aka.ms/MyVisualStudioBenefits) to get a developer account that automatically renews regardless of development activiy. This account can only be used for testing purposes. See more information on [setting up your test accounts](https://support.office.com/article/Add-users-individually-or-in-bulk-to-Office-365-Admin-Help-1970f7d6-03b5-442f-b385-5880b9c256ec?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

## Enable Microsoft Teams for your organization

If Microsoft Teams is not yet enabled for your organization, you'll need to do that first. Take a look at our detailed guidance for [enabling Teams for your organization](/microsoftteams/how-to-roll-out-teams).

## Enable custom Teams apps and turn on custom app uploading

> Note: If you're using an O365 Developer Organization to build your app, these settings should already be configured to allow you to build, upload and test your app.

There are three settings involved in enabling custom apps and custom app uploading:

* **Org-wide custom app setting** - This setting either enables or disables custom apps for your organization. It needs to be on. 
* **Team custom app setting** - This setting is for each individual team inside Microsoft Teams. If you want to install your app for a specific team, this will need to be on for that team.
* **User custom app policy** - This set of settings controls the permissions for an individual user. You'll need to enable this for individuals you want to upload custom apps.

For complete information on how these settings interact see [Manage custom app policies and settings in Microsoft Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/teams-custom-app-policies-and-settings).

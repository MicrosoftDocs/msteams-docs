# Share to Teams from web apps

Share to Teams from web apps allows users to share a link directly to a chat, channel, or meeting without switching context. Third-party websites can use the launcher script to embed **Share to Teams** buttons on their webpages. When the **Share to Teams** button is selected, it opens the **Share to Teams** dialog, prompting the user to provide the required details to share the content.

The following image displays the dialog that appears when the user selects **Share to Teams**:

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Only the desktop versions of Microsoft&nbsp;Edge and Google Chrome are supported.
> * Usage of Freemium or guest accounts isn't supported.

You can also add link unfurling for the links shared through Share to Teams that are hosted in a web app, personal app, or tab. For more information, see [link unfurling](~/messaging-extensions/how-to/link-unfurling.md).

The following image displays the link unfurling experience through Share to Teams:

This article guides you on how to create and embed a Share to Teams button for your website, craft your website preview, and extend Share to Teams for Education.

The following video provides the basic steps on how to embed Share to Teams:

<br>

<!--## Steps

* Embed Share to Teams button on webpage.
* In the meeting tab, add additional logic to query shared content (new APIs to be built by Teams platform) and display the content within the tab experience.
* Allow users to present that content onto the meeting stage via the Share to Stage APIs.
* Notify users of shared content via link unfurling.-->

## Embed Share to Teams

There are two methods by which you can embed Share to Teams on your webpage. Based on the control you want on the Share to Teams button, you can use one of the following methods:

# [Method 1](#tab/method-1)

This method shows the simple and basic way to embed Share to Teams where you can customize the button and its functionality based on your requirements.

1. Add the `launcher.js` script on your webpage.

    ```html
    <script async defer src="https://teams.microsoft.com/share/launcher.js"></script>
    ```

1. Add an HTML element on your webpage with the `teams-share-button` in the `class` attribute and the link to share in the `data-href` attribute.

    ```html
    <div
      class="teams-share-button"
      data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>">
    </div>
    ```

    After configuration, the **Share to Teams** button gets added to your website.

    * If you want a different icon size for the Share to Teams button, use the `data-icon-px-size` attribute.

        ```html
        <div
          class="teams-share-button"
          data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
          data-icon-px-size="64">
        </div>
        ```

    * If the shared link requires user authentication or the URL preview from your link doesn't render properly in Teams, then you can disable the URL preview by adding the `data-preview` attribute and setting it to `false`.

        ```html
        <div
          class="teams-share-button"
          data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
          data-preview="false">
        </div>
        ```

    * To display a message of your choice in compose box, you can define your text in `data-msg-text` attribute.

         ```html
         <div
          class="teams-share-button"
          data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
          data-msg-text="<default-message-to-be-populated-in-compose-box>"
          data-preview="false">
          </div>
         ```

# [Method 2](#tab/method-2)

This method allows you to have some control over which button is dynamically rendered or when the script is executed. The script only runs when `shareToMicrosoftTeams.renderButtons(options)` is invoked.

Use `async shareToMicrosoftTeams.renderButtons(options)` API to trigger and render all share buttons that have the class nameâ€¯`teams-share-button` on the page.

*Procedure placeholder*

```javascript
`options` (optional): `{ elements?: HTMLElement[] }`
```

Currently, all share buttons are rendered on the page. If an `options (optional)` object is supplied with a list of elements, then only those elements are rendered into the **Share** buttons.

### Share content in meetings

Share to Teams from web apps now allows users to share content to a live or an upcoming meeting. By enabling content sharing to meetings, you can allow users to share information that creates a collaborative workspace within the meeting. For example, users can share workboards from a web app directly onto the meeting stage, facilitating a collective effort to gather and organize ideas.

Here's how the shared web content appears in the meeting stage:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/share-to-teams/share-meeting-live.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows app shared to the teams meeting stage.":::

Before you enable share content to meetings, you must ensure the following:

1. A [Microsoft Teams app with a tab](../../apps-in-teams-meetings/build-tabs-for-meeting.md) that supports meeting side panel and Share to Stage APIs.

2. To display the content on the meeting stage, the meeting app must support [Share to Stage APIs](../../apps-in-teams-meetings/build-apps-for-teams-meeting-stage.md) with two primary requirements:

    * The [app manifest](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md) that supports both the meeting stage and meeting side panel. You must configure `meetingStage` and `meetingSidePanel` as frame contexts in the app manifest. If not configured, meeting participants might not be able to view the content on stage.
    * The app that supports `MeetingStage.Write.Chat` permissions for taking control of the stage. This is a read permission requirement.

**Enable Share to Teams for meeting**

1. Add the `launcher.js` script on your webpage.

    ```html
    <script async defer src="https://teams.microsoft.com/share/launcher.js"></script>
    ```

1. Add an HTML element on your webpage with the `teams-share-button` in the `class` attribute and the link to share in the `data-href` attribute. To enable your users to share content in meetings from Share to Teams, add `allow-share-in-meeting` attribute and set it to `true`.

```html
    <div
    class="teams-share-button"
    data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
    data-allow-share-in-meeting="<true>"
    >
    </div>
```

After the configuration, the Share to Teams dialog appears with a **Present now** option. Present now allows the users to share content to an ongoing meeting.

## Craft your website preview

When your website is shared to Teams, the card that's inserted into the selected channel contains a preview of your website. You can control the behavior of this preview by ensuring the appropriate metadata is added to the website that's being shared, such as the `data-href` URL.  

To display the preview:

* You must include either a **Thumbnail image**, or both a **Title** and **Description**. For best results, include all three.
* The shared URL doesn't require authentication. If it requires authentication, you can share it, but the preview isn't created.

The following table outlines the necessary tags:

|Value|Meta tag| Open Graph|
|----|----|----|
|Title|`<meta name="title" content="Example Page Title">`|`<meta property="og:title" content="Example Page Title">`|
|Description|`<meta name="description" content="Example Page Description">`|`<meta property="og:description" content="Example Page Description">`|
|Thumbnail Image| None |`<meta property="og:image" content="http://example.com/image.jpg">`|

You can use either the HTML default versions or the Open Graph version.

## Share to Teams for Education

For teachers using the Share to Teams button, there's an additional option to `Create an Assignment` that enables you to quickly create an assignment in the chosen Team, based on the shared link. The following image displays Share to Teams for education:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/share-to-teams-popup-edu.png" alt-text="Share to Teams pop-up education":::

### Set default form values

You can select to set default values for the following fields on the Share to Teams form:

* Say something about this: `msgText`
* Assignment Instructions: `assignInstr`
* Assignment Title: `assignTitle`

#### Example

The default form values are given in the following example:

```html
<span
    class="teams-share-button"
    data-href="https://www.microsoft.com/education/products/teams"
    data-msg-text="Default Message"
    data-assign-title="Default Assignment Title"
    data-assign-instr="Default Assignment Instructions"
></span>
```

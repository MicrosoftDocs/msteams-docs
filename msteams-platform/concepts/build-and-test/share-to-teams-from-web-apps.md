# Share to Teams from web apps

Third-party websites can use the launcher script to embed Share to Teams buttons on their webpages. When you select Share to Teams button, it launches the Share to Teams experience in a pop-up window. This allows you to share a link directly to any person or Microsoft Teams channel without switching the context.

The following image displays the pop-up window for Share to Teams preview experience:

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Only the desktop versions of Microsoft&nbsp;Edge and Google Chrome are supported.
> * Use of Freemium or guest accounts is not supported.

You can also add link unfurling for the links shared through Share to Teams button hosted in web app, personal app or tab. For more information, see [link unfurling](~/messaging-extensions/how-to/link-unfurling.md).

The following image displays the link unfurling experience through Share to Teams button:

This article guides you on how to create and embed a Share to Teams button for your website, craft your website preview, and extend Share to Teams for Education.

## Embed a Share to Teams button

1. Add the `launcher.js` script on your webpage.

    ```html
    <script async defer src="https://teams.microsoft.com/share/launcher.js"></script>
    ```

1. Add an HTML element on your webpage with the `teams-share-button` class attribute and the link to share in the `data-href` attribute.

    ```html
    <div
      class="teams-share-button"
      data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>">
    </div>
    ```

    After completing this, the Teams icon gets added to your website. The following image shows the Share to Teams icon:

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/icons/share-to-teams-icon.png" alt-text="Share to Teams icon":::

1. Alternatively, if you want a different icon size for the Share to Teams button, use the `data-icon-px-size` attribute.

    ```html
    <div
      class="teams-share-button"
      data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
      data-icon-px-size="64">
    </div>
    ```

1. If the shared link requires user authentication, and the URL preview from your link to be shared doesn't render well in Teams, then you can disable the URL preview by adding the `data-preview` attribute set to `false`.

    ```html
    <div
      class="teams-share-button"
      data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
      data-preview="false">
    </div>
    ```

1. To display a message of your choice in compose box, you can define your text in `data-msg-text` attribute.

     ```html
     <div
      class="teams-share-button"
      data-href="https://<link-to-be-shared>"
      data-msg-text="<default-message-to-be-populated-in-compose-box>"
      data-preview="false">
      </div>
     ```

1. If your page dynamically renders content, you can use the `shareToMicrosoftTeams.renderButtons()` method to force **Share** to render at the appropriate place in the pipeline.

## Craft your website preview

When your website is shared to Teams, the card that is inserted into the selected channel contains a preview of your website. You can control the behavior of this preview by ensuring the appropriate meta-data is added to the website being shared, such as the `data-href` URL.  

To display the preview:

* You must include either a **Thumbnail image**, or both a **Title** and **Description**. For best results, include all three.
* The shared URL doesn't require authentication. If it requires authentication, you can share it, but the preview isn't created.

The following table outlines the necessary tags:

|Value|Meta tag| Open Graph|
|----|----|----|
|Title|`<meta name="title" content="Example Page Title">`|`<meta property="og:title" content="Example Page Title">`|
|Description|`<meta name="description" content="Example Page Description">`|`<meta property="og:description" content="Example Page Description">`|
|Thumbnail Image| none. |`<meta property="og:image" content="http://example.com/image.jpg">`|

You can use either the HTML default versions or the Open Graph version.

## Share to Teams for Education

For teachers using the Share to Teams button, there's an additional option to `Create an Assignment` that enables you to quickly create an assignment in the chosen Team, based on the shared link. The following image displays Share to Teams for education:

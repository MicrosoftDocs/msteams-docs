# Developer Portal for Teams

<a href="https://dev.teams.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Developer Portal for Teams</a> (previously known as App Studio) is the primary tool for configuring, distributing, and managing your Microsoft Teams apps. With Developer Portal, you can collaborate with colleagues on your app, set up runtime environments, and much more.

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Developer Portal for Government Community Cloud (GCC) is supported only as an app in Teams and not as a standalone website.
> * Developer Portal isn't available for GCC-High and Department of Defense (DOD) tenants. However, you can use a regular tenant to build an app in Developer Portal, download the app, and upload the app using [Microsoft Graph](/graph/api/teamsapp-publish?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http&preserve-view=true) to a national cloud. For more information, see [national cloud deployments](/graph/deployments).

## Register an app

Developer Portal provides the following ways to register a Teams app:

* [Create and register a brand new app](#create-and-register-a-brand-new-app).

### Create and register a brand new app

1. Select the app manifest file, and then select **Open**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can receive an error message such as **Provided add-in package was not understood. Ensure that the file being submitted is a valid Office add-in package**, if there are nested folders or missing files in the app package folder.

1. Select **Import**.

   * Developer Portal creates a unique app ID and locks the ID for your registered Teams app. You canâ€™t edit or provide an ID of your choice, which prevents to have duplicate app IDs for multiple apps.
   * If you create an app using the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, you can manage your app in Developer Portal.
   * You can import an existing app to Developer Portal that was created in App Studio. If an app in your tenant doesn't have an owner, the Teams Tenant admin or Global admin can take ownership of the app from Teams Developer Portal.

#### Steps to import a published app that's not registered in Developer Portal

You might have published apps in Teams Store that wasn't registered in Developer Portal. If you want to monitor app analytics or validate your app, you must import your app into Developer Portal. While importing your published app, you might face the following error:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tdp/error-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of error message when you import an existing app in Teams Developer Portal."::: 

To resolve this error, we recommend that you raise a [support ticket](../../feedback.md) to Microsoft with the following details:

* App ID
* Tenant ID
* Your email ID
* Screenshot of the email from Partner Center when the app was published.

This information is required to verify the app owner's identity, who raises the ticket and to allow them to import an app.

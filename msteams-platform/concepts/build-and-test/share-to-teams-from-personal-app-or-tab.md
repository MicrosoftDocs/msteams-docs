## Enable Share to Teams button

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you have [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library](../../tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-library.md) (`@microsoft/teams-js@1.11.0-beta.7` or later) to enable Share to Teams for your personal app or tab.

To enable Share to Teams:

1. Create a personal app or tab with **Teams Javascript client library**.

2. Create a **Share to Teams** button.

3. On Share to Teams button, call `microsoftTeams.sharing.shareWebContent` with a content payload.

The following example explains how to create a content payload:

```json
microsoftTeams.sharing.shareWebContent({
        content: [
          {
            type: 'URL',
            url: '<URL to be shared>',
            message: 'Default message to be loaded in the compose box',
            preview: true
          }
        ]
      });
```

The payload contains the following parameters:

| Property name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `type` | The type must be `URL` |
| `url` | `URL` to be shared |
|`message`| Default message to be loaded in the compose box |
| `preview` | Set to `true` to enable URL preview |

# Microsoft Adaptive Card Previewer Microsoft Visual Studio

The Adaptive Card Previewer, integrated with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio, enables real-time previews of Adaptive Cards created for Microsoft Teams bots. You can open a side-by-side preview of your Adaptive Card to observe live changes, switch between different themes, and refine your designs to ensure they're accurate and effective.

## Explore Adaptive Card Previewer

Adaptive Card Previewer provides faster and more reliable solutions to preview Adaptive Card designs. Adaptive Card Previewer supports the following features:

* **Teams Toolkit Integration**: Enables Just-in-Time (JIT) installation of Adaptive Card Previewer when you update Adaptive Cards generated from a Teams Toolkit project.

* **Instant preview**: Allows you to preview Adaptive Cards in Visual Studio editor through CodeLens.

* **Data separation**: Enables you to separate data from the layout in an Adaptive Card [template language](/adaptive-cards/templating/). Use the command `Adaptive Card: New Data File` to add a data file to a template, which generates an empty file where you can bind data to the Adaptive Card template.

* **Switch themes**: Allows you to switch between light, dark, and high contrast themes to preview your Adaptive Cards.

## Advantages

The Adaptive Card Previewer offers the following benefits:

* **Quick updates**: Allows you to preview Adaptive Card designs within their integrated development environment and eliminates the need to switch between tools constantly. You can create a bot or message extension with Teams Toolkit, open the Adaptive Card metadata file, and use **CodeLens** or a specific command to preview the card. Any update or changes to the card are reflected instantly through the **Hot Reload** feature in the Adaptive Card Previewer.

* **Reliable previews**: Uses the same rendering stack as Teams and Outlook to ensure accurate and consistent preview results are aligned with the actual card rendering.

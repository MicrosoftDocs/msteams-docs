# Deep link to an application

Deep links in Microsoft Teams are powerful tools that allow users to navigate directly to specific content or actions within an app. Deep links are configured to perform various actions such as opening a tab, initiating an app install dialog, or browsing within the app.

[!INCLUDE [sdk-include](~/includes/sdk-include.md)]

## Deep link scenarios

Here are some of the scenarios where you can use a deep link:

* **App installation**: You can use deep links that allow users to know more about an app and install it in different scopes.
* **Bots and connectors**: You can use deep links in [bots](~/bots/what-are-bots.md) and [connectors](~/webhooks-and-connectors/what-are-webhooks-and-connectors.md) messages to inform users about changes to your tab or its items.
* **Navigate to specific page**: You can create deep links that allow users to navigate to specific pages within your app.
* **Custom app**: You can generate deep links for a custom app. However, if an app in the Microsoft Teams Store shares the same app ID as the custom app ID, the deep link opens the app from Teams Store instead of the custom app.
* **For mobile**: You can also create a deep link to an app for mobile after your app is approved for the Teams mobile client. For the deep link to work on Teams iOS, you need the Apple App Store Connect Team ID. For more information, see [how to update Apple App Store Connect Team ID](../deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/update-apple-store-team-connect-id.md).

## Deep link to open an app install dialog

Deep links allow app users to open an app install dialog to know any information about the app or install it in different contexts. You can create a deep link to an app in the following ways:

* [Configure deep link manually using the app ID](#configure-deep-link-manually-using-the-app-id)
* [Configure deep link using TeamsJS](#configure-deep-link-using-teamsjs)

### Configure deep link manually using the app ID

With deep link, you can open an app installation dialog directly from your Teams client using the app ID.

# [Deep link format](#tab/format1)

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/<your-app-id>?tenantId=<tenantId>`

`<your-app-id>` is your application ID (fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx).

# [Example](#tab/example1)

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx?tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47`

---

#### App ID for different types of apps

The following table lists the different types of app IDs used for different types of apps for deep links:

| Type of app | Type of app ID |
| --- | --- |
| Custom app uploaded in Teams | Manifest ID |
| Apps submitted to org catalog | Org catalog ID |
| Apps submitted to Teams Store | Store ID |

For more information, see [how to find ID based on the app manifest ID](/graph/api/appcatalogs-list-teamsapps#example-3-find-application-based-on-the-teams-app-manifest-id).

### Configure deep link using TeamsJS

Apps can use the Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library (TeamsJS) to initiate the app install dialog, eliminating the need for manual deep link generation. Here's an example of how to trigger the app install dialog using TeamsJS within your app:

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

```javascript
// Open an app install dialog from your tab
if(appInstallDialog.isSupported()) {
    const dialogPromise = appInstallDialog.openAppInstallDialog({ appId: "<appId>" });
    dialogPromise.
      then((result) => {/*Successful operation*/}).
      catch((error) => {/*Unsuccessful operation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }
```

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

```javascript
// Open an app install dialog from your tab
microsoftTeams.executeDeepLink("https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/<appId>");
```

---

For more information, see [`appInstallDialog`](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/appinstalldialog?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true#@microsoft-teams-js-appinstalldialog-openappinstalldialog).

## Deep link to browse within your app

App users can browse content in Teams from your tab using TeamsJS. You can use a deep link to browse within your app if your tab needs to connect users with other content in Teams, such as a channel, message, another tab, or to open a scheduling dialog. In a few instances, navigation can also be accomplished using TeamsJS, and we recommend using the typed capabilities of TeamsJS wherever possible.

You can configure deep links to browse within your app in the following ways:

* [Configure deep link to browse within your app manually](#configure-deep-link-to-browse-within-your-app-manually)
* [Configure deep link to a tab using TeamsJS](#configure-deep-link-to-a-tab-using-teamsjs)
* [Configure deep link to navigate between tabs](#configure-deep-link-to-navigate-between-tabs)

### Configure deep link to browse within your app manually

Personal tabs have a `personal` scope, while channel and group tabs use `team` or `group` scopes. The two tab types have slightly different syntax since only the configurable tab has a `channel` property associated with its context object. For more information on tab scopes, see [app manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md).

# [Deep link format](#tab/format2)

For creating a deep link in a bot, connector, or message extension card, use the following format:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<appId>/<entityId>?tenantId=<tenantId>&webUrl=<entityWebUrl>&label=<entityLabel>&context=<context>&openInMeeting=false`

* If the bot sends a message containing a `TextBlock` with a deep link, then a new browser tab is opened when the user selects the link. This happens in Chrome and in the Teams desktop app when they're running on Linux.

* If the bot sends the same deep link URL into an `Action.OpenUrl`, then the Teams tab opens in the current browser tab when the user selects the link.

# [Examples](#tab/examples2)

Here are the examples to create deep link to browse within your app:

* Deep link to a personal tab:
        
    >`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123&label=Task List 123`
    
* Deep link to a task item within the personal tab:
        
    >`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123/456&label=Task 456&context={"subEntityId": "task456"}`
    
* Deep link to a configurable tab:
        
    >`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123&label=Task List 123&context={"channelId": "19:cbe3683f25094106b826c9cada3afbe0@thread.skype"}`
    
* Deep link to a task item within the configurable tab:
        
    >`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123/456&label=Task 456&context={"subEntityId": "task456","channelId": "19:cbe3683f25094106b826c9cada3afbe0@thread.skype"}`
    
* Deep link to a tab app added to a meeting or group chat:
        
    >`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123/456&label=Task 456?context={"chatId": "17:b42de192376346a7906a7dd5cb84b673@thread.v2","contextType":"chat"}`

---

**Query parameters**

| Parameter name | Description |
|:------------|:--------------|
| `appId`&emsp; | The ID from Microsoft Teams admin center. <br> <br> **Example**: fe4a8eba-2a31-4737-8e33-e5fae6fee194 |
| `entityId`&emsp; | The ID of the tab, which you provided when [configuring the tab](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md). When generating a URL for deep linking, continue to use entity ID as a parameter name in the URL. When configuring the tab, the context object refers to the `entityId` as `page.id`. <br> <br> **Example**: Tasklist 123 |
| `entityWebUrl` or `subEntityWebUrl`&emsp; | An optional field with a fallback URL to use if the client doesn't support rendering the tab. <br> <br> **Example**: `https://tasklist.example.com/123` <br> or <br> `https://tasklist.example.com/list123/task456` |
| `entityLabel` or `subEntityLabel`&emsp; | A label for the item in your tab to use when displaying the deep link. <br> <br> **Example**: Task List 123 or Task 456 |
| `context.subEntityId`&emsp; | An ID for the item within the tab. When generating a URL for deep linking, continue to use `subEntityId` as the parameter name in the URL. When configuring the tab, the context object refers to the `subEntityId` as `page.subPageId`. <br> <br> **Example**: Task 456 |
| `context.channelId`&emsp; | Microsoft Teams channel ID that is available from the tab [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md). This property is available only in configurable tabs with a scope of **team**. It isn't available in static tabs, which has a **personal** scope. <br> <br> **Example**: 19:cbe3683f25094106b826c9cada3afbe0@thread.skype |
| `context.chatId`&emsp; | Chat ID that is available from the tab [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) for group and meeting chat. <br> <br> **Example**: 17:b42de192376346a7906a7dd5cb84b673@thread.v2 |
| `context.contextType`&emsp; | Chat is the only supported `contextType` for meetings. <br> <br> **Example**: chat |
|`openInMeeting`| Use `openInMeeting` to control the user experience when the target tab is associated with a meeting. If user interacts with the deep link in an ongoing meeting experience, Teams opens the app in the in-meeting side panel. Set this value to `false` to always open the app in the meeting chat tab rather than the side panel, regardless of the meeting status. Teams ignores any value other than `false`. <br> <br> **Example**: `false` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Ensure that all the query parameters and the white spaces are properly URI encoded. Following is an example of URI encoded query parameters:
>
>   ```javascript
>   var encodedWebUrl = encodeURIComponent('https://tasklist.example.com/123/456&label=Task 456');
>   var encodedContext = encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({"subEntityId": "task456"}));
>   var taskItemUrl = 'https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fe4a8eba-2a31-4737-8e33-e5fae6fee194/tasklist123?webUrl=' + encodedWebUrl + '&context=' + encodedContext;
>   ```
>
> * Deep link to a Teams app with encoded URI isn't supported in Outlook.

For more information on how to get the query parameters for the built-in tab types, see [configure the built-in tab types in Microsoft Teams](/graph/teams-configuring-builtin-tabs).

### Configure deep link to a tab using TeamsJS

You can configure deep links in your app through TeamsJS to allow users to browse different pages within your app. The navigation behavior of a Teams app extended across Microsoft 365 Office is dependent on two factors:

1. The target that the deep link points to.
1. The host where the Teams app is running.

If the Teams app is running within the host where the deep link is targeted, your app opens directly within the host. However, if the Teams app is running in a different host from where the deep link is targeted, the app first opens in the browser.

<br>

<details>
<summary>Support for deep links in TeamsJS</summary>

TeamsJS enables Teams apps extended across Outlook and Microsoft 365 to check if the host supports the capability you're attempting to use. To check a host's support of a capability, you can use the `isSupported()` function associated with the namespace of the API. TeamsJS organizes APIs into capabilities by way of namespaces. For example, before using an API in the `pages` namespace, you can check the returned Boolean value from `pages.isSupported()` and take the appropriate action within the context of your app and app's UI.  For more information, see [building tabs and other hosted experiences with the TeamsJS library](~/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md#apis-organized-into-capabilities).

</details>

The following code demonstrates how to navigate to a specific entity within your Teams app:

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

You can trigger navigation from your tab using the [pages.navigateToApp()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-navigatetoapp) function as shown in the following code:

```javascript
if (pages.isSupported()) {
  const navPromise = pages.navigateToApp({ appId: <appId>, pageId: <pageId>, webUrl: <webUrl>, subPageId: <subPageId>, channelId:<channelId>});
  navPromise.
     then((result) => {/*Successful navigation*/}).
     catch((error) => {/*Failed navigation*/});
}
else { /* handle case where capability isn't supported */ }
```

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

To trigger a deep link from your tab, call:

```javascript
microsoftTeams.executeDeepLink(/*deepLink*/);
```

---

* For more information, see [navigate within a tab app](../../tabs/how-to/tab-navigation.md).
* For more information on the pages capability, see [pages.navigateToApp()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-navigatetoapp) and the [pages](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true) namespace for other navigation options.
* To directly open a deep link using app.openLink(), see [app.openLink()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/app?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true#@microsoft-teams-js-app-openlink) function.

### Configure deep link to navigate between tabs

The [pages](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages) capability of the TeamsJS library provides support for navigation between tabs within an app. Specifically, the [`pages.currentApp`](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages.currentapp) namespace offers a function `navigateTo(NavigateWithinAppParams)` to allow navigation to a specific tab within the current app and a function `navigateToDefaultPage()` to navigate to the first tab defined in the app's manifest. The following code illustrates how to navigate to a specific and default tab:

# [Specific tab](#tab/specific)

The following code illustrates how to navigate to a specific tab:

```typescript
if (pages.currentApp.isSupported()) {
    const navPromise = pages.currentApp.navigateTo({pageId: <pageId>, subPageId: <subPageId>});
    navPromise.
        then((result) => {/*Successful navigation*/}).
        catch((error) => {/*Failed navigation*/});
}
else {/*Handle situation where capability isn't supported*/
    const navPromise = pages.navigateToApp({appId: <appId>, pageId: <pageId>});
    navPromise.
        then((result) => {/*Successful navigation*/}).
        catch((error) => {/*Failed navigation*/});
}
```

# [Default tab](#tab/default)

The following code illustrates how to navigate to the app's default tab:

```typescript

if (pages.currentApp.isSupported()) {
    const navPromise = pages.currentApp.navigateToDefaultPage();
    navPromise.
        then((result) => {/*Successful navigation*/}).
        catch((error) => {/*Failed navigation*/});
}
else {/*Handle situation where capability isn't supported*/}
```

---

> [!NOTE]
> The tab app navigation is supported only in [new Teams client](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/teams-updates).

#### Configure back button navigation

When an app has multiple tabs, a user can use the Microsoft 365 host app's back button to go backwards through the navigational history. However, the history doesn't include the actions a user performs within a tab. If you want to enhance the back button experience, you can maintain your own internal navigation stack and configure a custom handler for back button selections. This can be accomplished through the `registerBackButtonHandler()` function in the [`pages.backStack`](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages.backstack) namespace.

After you register the handler, it helps you to address the navigational request before the system takes action. If the handler is able to manage the request, it should return `true` so that the system knows no further action is necessary. If the internal stack is empty, it should return `false` so that the system can call the `navigateBack()` function instead and take the appropriate action.

#### Return focus to host app

After the user starts using elements within a tab, by default, the focus remains with the elements of your iFrame until the user selects outside of it. If the iFrame is a part of the user navigating with keyboard shortcuts (the Tab key or the F6 key), you can focus on the host app. You can focus on the host app by using the [`pages.returnFocus()`](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-returnfocus) function. The `returnFocus()` function accepts a Boolean indicating the direction to advance focus within the host app; `true` for forward and `false` for backwards. Generally, forward highlights the search bar and backwards highlights the app bar.

## Deep link to a chat with the application

You can allow app users to browse to a personal chat with the application by configuring the deep link manually.

# [Deep link format](#tab/format3)

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<appId>/conversations?tenantId=<tenantId>`

`appId` is your application ID. For more information, see [app ID for different types of apps](#app-id-for-different-types-of-apps).

# [Example](#tab/example3)

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/conversations?tenantId=abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`

You can replace the placeholder values with your actual `appId` and `tenantId` to create a functional deep link for your specific application and tenant.

---

## Share a deep link for a tab

You can share deep links to entities in Teams apps to navigate to the content and information within your tab app. For example, if your tab app contains a task list, team members can create and share links to individual tasks. When the app user selects the link, it navigates to your tab that focuses on the specific item.

# [TeamsJS v2](#tab/teamsjs-v2)

Add a **copy link** action to each item in whatever way best suits your UI. When the user takes this action, call [`pages.shareDeepLink()`](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-sharedeeplink) to display a dialog containing a link that the user can copy to the clipboard. When you make this call, pass an ID for your item. You get it back in [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) when the link is followed, and your tab is reloaded.

```javascript
pages.shareDeepLink({ subPageId: <subPageId>, subPageLabel: <subPageLabel>, subPageWebUrl: <subPageWebUrl> })
```

You must replace the following parameters with the appropriate information:

| Parameter name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `subPageId` | A unique identifier for the item within your page to which you're deep linking. |
| `subPageLabel` | A label for the item to use for displaying the deep link. |
| `subPageWebUrl` | A fallback URL to use if the client can't render the page. |

For more information, see [pages.shareDeepLink()](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teams-js/pages?view=msteams-client-js-latest&preserve-view=true#@microsoft-teams-js-pages-sharedeeplink).

# [TeamsJS v1](#tab/teamsjs-v1)

Add a **copy link** action to each item in whatever way best suits your UI. When the user takes this action, call `shareDeepLink()` to display a dialog containing a link that the user can copy to the clipboard. When you make this call, pass an ID for your item. You get it back in [context](~/tabs/how-to/access-teams-context.md) when the link is followed and your tab is reloaded.

```javascript
microsoftTeams.shareDeepLink({ subEntityId: <subEntityId>, subEntityLabel: <subEntityLabel>, subEntityWebUrl: <subEntityWebUrl> })
```

You must replace the following parameters with the appropriate information:

| Parameter name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `subEntityId` | A unique identifier for the item within your tab to which you're deep linking. |
| `subEntityLabel` | A label for the item to use for displaying the deep link. |
| `subEntityWebUrl` | An optional parameter with a fallback URL to use if the client doesn't support rendering the tab. |

---

> [!NOTE]
>
> * This deep link is different from the links provided by the **Copy link to tab** menu item, which only generates a deep link that points to this tab.
> * `shareDeepLink` doesn't work on Teams mobile platforms.

## Deep link for SharePoint Framework tabs

Deep links for SharePoint Framework (SPFx) tabs allow users to navigate directly to specific tabs within a SharePoint site or Teams app. This enhances user experience by providing quick access to relevant content and functionality.

# [Deep link format](#tab/format4)

You can use the following deep link format in a bot, connector, or message extension card:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<appId>/<EntityId>?webUrl=<entityWebUrl>/<EntityName>`.

# [Example](#tab/example4)

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123&TaskList`

---

> [!NOTE]
>
> * When a bot sends a `TextBlock` message with a deep link, a new browser tab opens when users select the link. This happens in Chrome and Microsoft Teams desktop app running on Linux.
> * If the bot sends the same deep link URL in an `Action.OpenUrl`, the Teams tab opens in the current browser when the user selects the link. No new browser tab is opened.

**Query parameters**

| Value |  Description |
| --- | --- |
| `APP_ID` | Your manifest ID. <br> <br> **Example**: `fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `entityID` | The item ID that you provided when [configuring the tab](~/tabs/how-to/create-tab-pages/configuration-page.md). <br> <br> **Example**: `tasklist123` |
| `entityWebUrl` | A fallback URL to use if the client doesn't support rendering of the tab. <br> <br> **Example**: `https://tasklist.example.com/123` or `https://tasklist.example.com/list123/task456` |
| `entityName` | A label for the item in your tab to use when displaying the deep link. <br> <br> **Example**: `Task List 123` or `Task 456` |

## Deep link to open a dialog

A dialog deep link is a serialization of the `TaskInfo` object with two other details, the `APP_ID` and optionally the `BOT_APP_ID`.

# [Deep link format](#tab/format3)

* `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/task/APP_ID?url=<TaskInfo.url>&height=<TaskInfo.height>&width=<TaskInfo.width>&title=<TaskInfo.title>&completionBotId=BOT_APP_ID`

* `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/task/APP_ID?card=<TaskInfo.card>&height=<TaskInfo.height>&width=<TaskInfo.width>&title=<TaskInfo.title>&completionBotId=BOT_APP_ID`

# [Example](#tab/example3)

* `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/task/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ftask&height=600&width=800&title=Example%20Task&completionBotId=abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`

* `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/task/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx?card=%7B%22content%22%3A%22example%20card%20content%22%7D&height=600&width=800&title=Example%20Task&completionBotId=abcdef12-3456-7890-abcd-ef1234567890`

---

For the data types and allowable values for `<TaskInfo.url>`, `<TaskInfo.card>`, `<TaskInfo.height>`, `<TaskInfo.width>`, and `<TaskInfo.title>`, see [TaskInfo object](~/task-modules-and-cards/task-modules/invoking-task-modules.md#dialoginfo-object).

> [!TIP]
> Encode the deep link URL when using the `card` parameter, for example, JavaScript [`encodeURI()` function](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_encodeURI.asp).

The following table provides information on `APP_ID` and `BOT_APP_ID`:

| Value | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_ID` | string | Yes | - For third-party apps, use the app `id` from manifest or the `APP_ID` from Teams admin center as they're identical. <br> <br> - For custom apps or custom apps built for your org (LOB apps), use the `APP_ID` from Teams admin center or use the [Graph API](/graph/api/application-list). <br> <br> - The [validDomains array](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#validdomains) in the manifest for `APP_ID` must contain the domain for `url` if `url` is present in the deep-link URL. The app ID is already known when a dialog is invoked from a tab or a bot, which is why it isn't included in `TaskInfo`. |
| `BOT_APP_ID` | string | No | If a value for `completionBotId` is specified, the `result` object is sent using a `task/submit invoke` message to the specified bot. Specify `BOT_APP_ID` must be specified as a bot in the app's manifest, which you can't send to any bot. |

> [!NOTE]
> `APP_ID` and `BOT_APP_ID` can be the same in many cases, if an app has a recommended bot to use as an app's ID and if there is one.

## Deep link to share content in meeting stage

You can also generate a deep link to [share the app to stage](~/apps-in-teams-meetings/enable-and-configure-your-app-for-teams-meetings.md#share-entire-app-to-stage) and start or join a meeting.

For deep links to share content to stage, see [deep link to share content to stage in meetings](~/concepts/build-and-test/share-in-meeting.md#generate-a-deep-link-to-share-content-to-stage-in-meetings).

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Generating a deep link to share content to stage in meetings is available only in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).
> * Deep link to share content to stage in meeting is supported in Teams desktop client only.

## Deep link to meeting side panel

You can generate a deep link to the [meeting side panel](~/apps-in-teams-meetings/build-tabs-for-meeting.md#deep-link-to-meeting-side-panel) in a meeting. 

# [Deep link format](#tab/format5)

Use the following format for a deep link to the meeting side panel:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<appId>/<entityId>?webUrl=<entityWebUrl>&label=<entityLabel>&context=<context>`.

# [Example](#tab/example5)

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/fxxxxxxx-0xxx-4xxx-8xxx-cxxxxxxxxxxx/tasklist123?webUrl=https://tasklist.example.com/123/456&label=Task 456&context={"chatId": "17:b42de192376346a7906a7dd5cb84b673@thread.v2","contextType":"chat"}`

---

By default, a deep link opens in a meeting side panel. To open a deep link directly in an app rather than the meeting side panel, add `openInMeeting=false` as shown in the following deep link format:

`https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/<appId>/<entityId>?webUrl=<entityWebUrl>&label=<entityLabel>&context=<context>&openInMeeting=false`

For more information, see [deep link to a tab](#configure-deep-link-to-browse-within-your-app-manually).

A deep link doesn't open in the meeting side panel in the following scenarios:

* There's no active meeting.
* The app doesn't have `sidePanel` context declared in the app manifest.
* `openInMeeting` is set to `false` in the deep link.
* The deep link is selected outside of the meeting window or component.
* The deep link doesn't match the current meeting, for example, if the deep link is created from another meeting.

## Deep link to invoke Stageview

You can invoke Stageview through a deep link from your tab by wrapping the deep link URL in the `app.openLink(url)` API. The deep link can also be passed through an `OpenURL` action in the card. The `openMode` property defined in the API determines the Stageview response. For more information, see [invoke Stageview through deep link](../../tabs/tabs-link-unfurling.md#invoke-from-deep-link).

## Best practices

* Deep links work properly only if the tab was configured using the library v0.4 or later, as it has an entity ID. Deep links to tabs without entity IDs still go to the tab but can't provide the sub`EntityId to the tab.
* In Microsoft Windows, Teams can't handle deep links exceeding 2048 characters due to the `INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH` limit in Windows ShellExecuteEx API. 
* When creating a deep link, ensure that the path to the Teams client and other metadata fit within this limit. 
* If your deep link contains large data, include a unique identifier in the link that your app can use to fetch the necessary data from your backend service.

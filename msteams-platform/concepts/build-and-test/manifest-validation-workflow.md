# App manifest validation

The app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) describes how your app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product. Your app manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.23/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.23/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json). Previous versions 1.0, 1.1,...,1.22, and the current version is 1.23 are each supported (using "v1.x" in the URL). Version 1.18 isn't available.
For more information on the changes made in each version, see [app manifest change log](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/releases) and for previous versions, see [app manifest versions](https://github.com/microsoft/json-schemas/tree/main/teams).

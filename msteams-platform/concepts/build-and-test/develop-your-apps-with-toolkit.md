# Develop your apps with Agents Toolkit

After you create your app in Developer Portal for Teams, you can:

* [Open your app in Visual Studio Code](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio-code).
* [Open your app in Visual Studio](#open-your-app-in-visual-studio).

Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit) scaffolds the necessary files based on the feature and configurations you set in Developer Portal. This makes a seamless transition between Developer Portal and Agents Toolkit in Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio.

## Open your app in Visual Studio Code

In Developer Portal, you can open and launch your project (React app) in Visual Studio Code.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable your app to open, install the latest version of [Agents Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](../../toolkit/install-Teams-Toolkit.md).

Following are the steps to open your app in Visual Studio Code from Developer Portal:

1. Sign in to [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com) and select **Apps** from the left pane.
1. Select **Develop** > **Open in Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit** > **Open in Visual Studio Code (JS/TS)**.

## Open your app in Visual Studio

You can open your project in Visual Studio and scaffold your project in Visual Studio with Agents Toolkit. Ensure that you installed [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.6 Preview 2](/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-preview#17.6.0-pre.2.0).

Following are the steps to open your app in Visual Studio from Developer Portal:

1. Sign in to [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com) and select **Apps** from the left pane.
1. Select **Develop** > **Open in Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit** > **Open in Visual Studio (.NET)**.

After you open your app in Agents Toolkit, you can now [develop](/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-multi-env) and [debug](../../toolkit/debug-overview.md) your Teams app in Agents Toolkit.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can work in Agents Toolkit through Developer Portal in preview version only.

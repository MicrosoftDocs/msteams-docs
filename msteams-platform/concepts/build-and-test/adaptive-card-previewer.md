## FAQs

<details>
<summary>Why do we have to use a new extension in Visual Studio Code? Canâ€™t this extension be integrated into Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code?</summary>

Adaptive Card Previewer is a standalone extension because it uses a closed-source package to render the Adaptive Cards to ensure consistent rendering logic with the Teams platform. Teams Toolkit is an open-source project and doesn't include dependencies on packages that third-party developers can't access.

Below is an additional scenario that highlights when you might use nested app authentication (NAA):

| Scenario                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **Unified Cross-Service Experience** | Karen, a project manager at Contoso, uses a unified enterprise portal built into Microsoft Teams. The portal hosts multiple nested apps—including an analytics dashboard, a CRM management tool, and a document library viewer—all integrated within a single Teams tab. With NAA enabled, once Karen signs in to the portal, each nested app automatically receives a valid token without additional sign‐in prompts. This seamless, single sign-on experience ensures that Karen can switch between these diverse services quickly and securely, improving productivity and reducing repeated authentication challenges. |
------------------------------------------------------------

In this scenario, NAA streamlines the user experience by propagating the original authentication token to all nested applications. This not only minimizes disruptions for Karen as she moves between functionality but also reinforces security by ensuring that each embedded app receives tokens directly from Microsoft Entra ID without requiring a server-to-server On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow.

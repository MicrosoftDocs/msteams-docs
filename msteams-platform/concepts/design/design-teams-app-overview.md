# Designing your Microsoft Teams app

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines-overview.png" alt-text="Conceptual image introducing the Microsoft Teams design guidelines.":::

Whether you're a designer, product manager, developer, or a maker using low-code tools, these guidelines provide clear direction to help you make the right design decisions for your Microsoft Teams app quickly and efficiently.

## Creating a cohesive experience

Designing a Teams app is similar to designing a traditional web app but comes with some unique considerations. A successful design not only shines a light on your app's distinctive attributes but also ensures it integrates seamlessly with core Teams features and contexts.

These guidelines and resources empower you to achieve the ideal balance. They detail best practices—such as avoiding multilevel navigation in a tab—and caution against pitfalls, ensuring that your design is both innovative and user-friendly.

## Teams app design principles

Microsoft Teams apps are crafted to help people achieve more together. Use the following design principles as your guide:

### Collaborative

- The app fosters teamwork and shared activities among users.
- It is designed to enhance communication and collaboration, ensuring that team interactions are smooth and efficient.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Trustworthy

- Security and compliance are central; the app protects user data.
- Users can effortlessly access clear information about privacy and data handling practices.

### Globally inclusive

- The app’s design is mindful of a diverse user base, including people from various backgrounds and skill levels.
- It incorporates cultural, racial, and social awareness to ensure everyone feels welcome and can easily navigate the system.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Light

- The focus is on essential scenarios that integrate naturally with Teams workflows.
- Avoid overcomplicating the design; instead, emphasize clarity and efficiency in user interactions.

   :::column span="":::

### Native or distinct

- Your app should either adopt native Teams design components or establish its own consistent design language.
- It is important to maintain uniform color schemes, control styles, and visual elements rather than mixing different design paradigms.

   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::

### Useful

- The app is designed around key scenarios that address real user needs within Teams.
- Ensure that every feature has a clear purpose and helps users accomplish their tasks effectively.

## Teams design system

Discover the [fundamentals of Teams app design](design-teams-app-fundamentals.md). This resource covers essential topics such as layout, color schemes, and other crucial design components that empower you to craft consistent experiences.

## App capabilities

Enhance your understanding of how people add, use, and manage Teams apps by exploring these capabilities. Applying this knowledge will help you design features that maximize each capability’s potential:

* [Personal apps](../../concepts/design/personal-apps.md) – Designs focused on individual productivity.
* [Tabs](../../tabs/design/tabs.md) – Customizable tab experiences that integrate with Teams.
* [Message extensions](../../messaging-extensions/design/messaging-extension-design.md) – Enhance conversations with rich messaging tools.
* [Bots](../../bots/design/bots.md) – Interactive bots designed to provide assistance and streamline tasks.
* [Meeting extensions](../../apps-in-teams-meetings/design/designing-apps-in-meetings.md) – Enhancements that enrich meeting experiences.

## UI templates

Boost your design workflow by exploring [templates for common Teams use cases and workflows](design-teams-app-ui-templates.md). These templates, along with app playbooks, provide a powerful starting point for creating apps that extend seamlessly across Microsoft 365. Check out the [apps extended across Microsoft 365](../../m365-apps/overview.md#app-planning-and-design) for more insights.

## Basic UI components

Leveraging the core elements based on Fluent UI can accelerate your design process. Explore these [basic UI components](design-teams-app-basic-ui-components.md) to build customized Teams experiences from the ground up.

## Tools and samples

The following tools are invaluable for both designers and developers, helping you initiate and refine your Teams app design:

### Microsoft Teams UI Kit

- Design your Teams app with a ready-made set of UI components, templates, and examples.
- The UI Kit allows for easy drag-and-drop modification, ensuring that your design adapts perfectly to different Teams scenarios.

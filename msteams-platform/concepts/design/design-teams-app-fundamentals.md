# Microsoft Teams app design system

Quickly learn about the fundamentals of Teams app design. You can find comprehensive guidance and examples in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/916836509871353159" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams UI Kit (Figma)</a>.

## Layout

:::row:::

   :::column span="3":::

      Teams relies on a grid layout to ensure consistent and elegant relationships between design components. The grid’s 4-pixel base unit allows components to scale consistently across all display sizes in Teams.

      * [See full layout guidelines (Figma)](https://www.figma.com/community/file/916836509871353159)
      * [Implement layout (Fluent UI)](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/styles/web/layout)

## Avatars

:::row:::

   :::column span="3":::

      An avatar is a graphical representation of a person, team, bot, or entity in Teams. An avatar group is often used to convey live activity or a represent a roster in a way that preserves vertical space.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Icons

:::row:::

   :::column span="3":::

      Your app's primary icon can go a long way in conveying your brand to Teams users. Getting your icon design right is also important for [publishing your app](../../concepts/build-and-test/apps-package.md) to the Teams store.

      You also can use Fluent UI icons throughout your app:

:::row-end:::

## Type

:::row:::

   :::column span="3":::

      Teams uses Segoe UI for its type ramp and different font sizes and weights to help create hierarchy and ensure readability.

## Colors

:::row:::

   :::column span="3":::

      Teams web and desktop supports default (light), dark, and high-contrast themes, while Teams mobile supports light and dark themes. Each theme has its own color scheme.

## Shape and elevation

:::row:::

   :::column span="3":::

      You can use shape and elevation to create additional hierarchy in your app.

   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

## Copy and content

:::row:::

   :::column span="3":::

      To feel part of Teams, your app copy in general should follow these [Microsoft voice principles](/style-guide/brand-voice-above-all-simple-human): warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend hand.

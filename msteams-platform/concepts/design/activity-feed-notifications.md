## Custom activity icons

You can add custom activity icons in activity feed notifications to increase user engagement for your app. For more information, see [custom activity icons in activity feed notifications](/graph/teams-send-activityfeednotifications?toc=%2Fmicrosoftteams%2Fplatform%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fmicrosoftteams%2Fplatform%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=desktop%2Chttp#custom-activity-icons-in-activity-feed-notifications).

## Manage activity feed notifications

Users can manage notifications sent from your app in the Teams settings page.

## Related system notifications

Each activity generates a system notification. What displays depends on what the user configures in their notification settings. Users can also choose a notification style based on their operating system.

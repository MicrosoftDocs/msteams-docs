# Plan to monetize your app

One of the most important objectives for building a Teams app is to solve the problems of your users in a collaborative zone. An app that achieves this goal is fit for being a utility for global consumption. Microsoft Teams Store provides features that let you monetize your apps and gain customers by engaging with your users.

Consider publishing your app on Teams Store to offer your app the best platform for global visibility. Factors, such as type of app, nature of service, and target customers influence your choice for the best monetization option.

        The most common ways to monetize your app are:

        - **Subscription**: Include a Software-as-a-service (SaaS) offer with your app to let users purchase subscription plans.
        - **In-app purchases**: Offer a free app download with limited features. For advanced features, offer an upgraded version.
        - **Free trials**: Let the users try the app for free for a set number of days or times.
        - **Test preview**: Preview and test a SaaS offer before you publish your app.

In addition to these features, Teams Store also lets you:

- **Free trials**: Offer your app to users for a time-limited usage, so that users can try the app features for a set number of days or times.
- **Test preview**: Preview and test a SaaS offer before you publish your app.-->

Establishing a monetizing option beforehand helps guide the app design, build, and distribution decisions.

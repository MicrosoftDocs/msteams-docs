# Designing lightbox for your Microsoft Teams app

The lightbox is a display component that emphasizes important information by deactivating the page layout behind it. Information in the lightbox is noneditable and non-interactive. The lightbox view enables users to preview media content, including images, videos, audio files on a large surface over the main Teams window. 

The lightbox component is designed for quick reviews, understanding, or verification. It doesn't support actions for editing or collaboration. Users can initiate the lightbox in a new Teams window or open it directly in a native app or browser.

## Best practices

Recommended best practices for Lightbox

#### Do: Use a lightbox component to preview files that present media such an image, video, audio in a full-screen view

Help to save time during file opening. Opening on top of the main content. With easy navigation through the files and fast soft dismiss.

#### Don't: Use a lightbox for content editing or interaction

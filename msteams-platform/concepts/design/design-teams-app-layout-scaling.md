# Layout and scaling for your Microsoft Teams app

A grid layout allows your app to be consistent and guarantees recognizable relationships between design components. You can learn about your grid system and tips for scaling and zoom levels in your app to pass submission criteria.

Scaling and responsive design are essential to all Teams apps so that users can successfully interact with all interfaces with certainty. In order to pass Microsoft Teams Store review, the entire text must be visible and not truncated.

## Layout design

The 4-pixel base unit of grid allows components to scale consistently across all display sizes in Teams. In the following example, the corner radius of each button is 4 pixels.

### Always follow the grid

### Make it responsive

### Use white space

## Scaling and responsive

### Mobile

Mobile designs must be 320 pixels.

### Desktop

The minimum size for desktop is 550 pixels.

## Page orientation

### Mobile

> [!NOTE]
> Apps in Teams mobile support both landscape and portrait mode.

#### Portrait mode

#### Do: Use word wrap so that text is legible at all zoom levels

Avoid text overlap and truncation.

#### Don’t: Let text and buttons shift and overlap as zoom level changes

Overlapping text and buttons might not meet our accessibility standards.

#### Do: Use word wrap so that text is legible at all widths

Avoid truncation with reflow, prioritizing call to actions (CTAs), and action items.

   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines/word-wrap-width-dont.png" alt-text="Example shows that the text and CTAs aren't usable without word wrap.":::

#### Don’t: Let text or CTAs get cut off or become illegible as window width changes

Without word wrapping, the text and CTAs aren't usable.

#### Do: Ensure your app is legible at 200% scale

Use responsive design to avoid text overlap and truncation.

#### Don’t: Truncate and cut off content at any zoom level

It's recommended to test up to 200% zoom.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines/text-colors-do.png" alt-text="Example shows how the text should be visible and accessible for users.":::

#### Do: Text and colors for accessibility

The entire text must be visible and used for all users, meaning that it must exceed certain color ratios, depending on its usage. To check your contrast levels, check out the WebAIM contrast checker.

   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines/text-colors-dont.png" alt-text="Example shows a text that doesn't meet the contrast standards.":::

#### Don’t: Submit your app with text that doesn’t pass contrast standards

Teams apps need to be accessible to all users with any level of visual impairment or disability. Submissions with inaccessible text aren't accepted.

Nothing must be cut off or illegible on your mobile app.

##### Do: Ensure headers are always legible at all zoom levels

If the headers truncate, use a tooltip so that users can read headers by hovering.

   :::column span="":::
:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines/headers-dont.png" alt-text="Example shows a truncated header without a hover feature.":::

##### Don’t: Truncate headers without a hover feature

Your app won't pass Teams submission if it has illegible headers without hover functionality.

# Teams app icon for Teams Store and app bar

This article provides the guidelines for creating icons in your app ecosystem to help designers and you submit the correct application icon. Following these guidelines creates uniformity and balance in your app ecosystem and emphasizes the artwork of your app icon.

## App icon

When submitting your app package, include two PNG versions of the app icon, a color icon and an outline icon. For your app to pass Microsoft Teams Store review, these icons must meet certain size requirements. Follow the steps to ensure your app icons fit the Teams Store standards.

### Balanced layout

The icons are intended to create a uniform layout. These guidelines help you create your app icon for submission.

### Creating your assets

Microsoft Teams needs two assets during app submission to generate the app icons.

|Counter|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|1|A full bleed PNG format at 192 x 192 pixels. Utilize the full asset space as the background. This is used in the Teams Store or fly-outs.|
|2|A default or rest PNG format icon at 32 x 32 pixels. This icon is used as **rest/default** state in the app bar and other locations in the product. |

### Color icon architecture

The color app icon dimensions must be 192 x 192 pixels. If you have a logo icon, the logo needs to fit within the 120 x 120 safe area in the center.

The submitted icon must be a full square. Teams automatically applies masking for consistent icon shapes across the app.

## Best practices

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines/safe-area-do.png" alt-text="Example shows a logo within the safe area.":::

#### Do: Follow the recommendation for safe area (120 x 120)

It's recommended that if you have a logo, keep it within the 120 x 120 safe area inside of the 192 x 192 PNG format icon.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines/safe-area-dont.png" alt-text="Example shows a logo that is not within the safe area.":::

#### Don’t: Make the icon bigger than the safe area

Here's an example of a logo inside of the PNG format icon that isn't within the safe area. It creates uneven padding (negative space) around the icon.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/design-guidelines/round-corners-do.png" alt-text="Example shows an icon with full bleed.":::

#### Do: Provide full bleed for rounded corners

If you have a full bleed image, just upload a square PNG format at 192 x 192. The corners are rounded dynamically.

#### Don’t: Add a border

Borders are added dynamically. If you include a border in your PNG format, it results in unwanted duplication on white backgrounds.

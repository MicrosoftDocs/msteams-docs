# Distribute your apps

## Distribute

After you have finished defining your application, the **Distribute** section allows you to export your app’s definition as a zip file which then can be shared and uploaded into the Teams client for testing. Clicking export downloads the zip file as **appname.zip** in your default download directory.

### Manifest

The manifest describes how your app is configured, including its capabilities, required resources, and other important attributes. See [manifest schema](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md) for more information.

### Flights

Control who gets app updates. For example, you can release an update to Microsoft employees to identify and fix bugs before releasing it to the public. Select **Create a New Request** to create a new flight request.

### Publish to org

Make your app available to people in your org. Once approved by your IT admin, your app will be featured in Teams under Apps > Built for your org.

### Publish your app to Teams store

On your project home page, you can upload your app to a team, submit your app to your company custom app store for users in your organization, or submit your app to App Source for all Teams users. Your IT admin will review these submissions. You can return to the **Publish** page to check on your submission status and learn if your app was approved or rejected by your IT admin. This is also where you'll come to submit updates to your app or cancel any currently active submissions.

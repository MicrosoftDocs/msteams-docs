    Microsoft Teams meeting side panel enhances your in-meeting experience and helps organizers and presenters to have different sets of views and actions.

    Key features of the meeting side panel are:

    * Provisions to add a new agenda point.
    * Adds the agenda as text input to the meeting side panel list.
    * Publishes the agenda list to the meeting chat.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to generate a meeting side panel to add and publish an agenda. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. Use the latest version or install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library (TeamsJS)](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client) | You can install the package using npm or yarn. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Live Share SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/live-share-sdk) | Live Share enables collaborative app experiences. |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> Or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm devDependencies). |
     
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

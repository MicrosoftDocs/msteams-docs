# Get started

Get started with building apps for Microsoft Teams and beyond!

Use GitHub Codespaces or walk through the step-by-step guide to build a basic, real-world Teams app. This module introduces you to common tools, fundamental concepts, and more advanced functionalities.

Here's an idea of what you'll learn:

* Get started quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit.
* Build tab, scenario-based apps, and message extension with GitHub Codespaces or step-by-step guide.
* Learn about tutorials and code samples available for building your Teams app.
* Learn about various tools and SDKs available for building your Teams app.

## Build your first Teams app

In this section, learn how to build a Teams app with different capabilities, such as tab, scenario-based bot app, and message extension.

1. Select the type of Teams app that you want to build:

   * **Build a basic Teams tab app**: Get started with building a Teams app with a basic tab app.

   * **Build a scenario-based Teams bot app**: Build a Teams app that is suitable for a particular scenario or use-case. For example, a notification bot is suitable for sending notifications but not to chat.

   * **Build message extension Teams app**: Build a search-based message extension Teams app.

2. Choose your path to build your selected app.

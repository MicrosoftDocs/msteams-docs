# Build your Teams app

Get started with building apps for Microsoft Teams and beyond!

This walkthrough helps you either use GitHub Codespaces or follow a detailed step-by-step guide to create a basic, real-world Teams app. In this module, you'll be introduced to common tools, fundamental concepts, and even more advanced functionalitiesâ€”all designed to support your development journey.

Here's an idea of what you'll learn:

* **Get started quickly with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit:** Discover how to initialize and set up your project with ease.
* **Build tab apps, scenario-based apps, and message extension apps:** Leverage GitHub Codespaces or a detailed guide to create various types of Teams apps, each with its unique functionality.
* **Explore tutorials and code samples:** Increase your understanding by diving into a library of examples available for building your Teams app.
* **Discover tools and SDKs:** Familiarize yourself with the multiple tools and Software Development Kits that can accelerate and simplify your development process.

## Build your first Teams app

In this section, you will learn how to create a Teams app by exploring different capabilities. You can build an app that includes a tab, a scenario-based bot, or a message extension. The following steps will guide you through the process:

1. Select the type of Teams app that you want to build:

   * **Build a basic Teams tab app:**  
     Start off by creating a simple and functional tab app. This approach is perfect if you're new to Teams app development and want to see immediate results.
  
   * **Build a scenario-based Teams bot app:**  
     Create an app that targets a particular scenario or use case. For instance, a notification bot is ideal for sending timely updates and alerts, rather than sustaining an ongoing chat.
  
   * **Build a message extension Teams app:**  
     Develop a search-based message extension that enhances the Teams messaging experience by allowing users to quickly search and insert content during conversations.

2. Choose your path to build your selected app:

   * **GitHub Codespaces:**  
     Utilize GitHub Codespaces if you prefer a cloud-based development environment. This option allows you to run, test, and debug your app without needing to install and configure a local setup.
	    
   * **Step-by-step guide:**  
     Follow an in-depth guide that walks you through creating a Teams app from scratch, including setting up your development environment, configuring necessary tools, and building the app incrementally.

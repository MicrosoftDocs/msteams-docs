# Apps in Teams

Teams apps are custom solutions designed to enhance collaboration and productivity within Microsoft Teams. They leverage the platform’s extensibility to deliver interactive experiences directly inside chats, channels, and meetings.

Teams platforms supports the following app types:

- **Tabs**: Embedded web experiences for dashboards, forms, or full-featured applications, accessible in chats, channels, or meetings.
- **Bots**: Conversational apps that respond to user queries, automate tasks, and participate in discussions or meetings.
- **Message extensions**: Tools that enable users to find and insert content or trigger actions from the compose box and contextual menus.
- **Meeting apps**: Solutions that add configurable tabs and bot capabilities to the meeting surface, supporting workflows like agenda management and action item tracking.

Get started with building apps for Microsoft Teams and beyond!

Here's an idea of what you'll learn

- Get started quickly with Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit).
- Build tab, scenario-based apps, and message extension with GitHub Codespaces or step-by-step guide.
- Learn about tutorials and code samples available for building your Teams app.
- Learn about various tools and SDKs available for building your Teams app.

## Build your first Teams app

In this section, learn how to build a Teams app with different capabilities, such as tab, scenario-based bot app, and message extension. Select the type of Teams app that you want to build:

- **Build a basic Teams tab app**: Get started with building a Teams app with a basic tab app.

- **Build a simple Teams bot app**: Build a Teams app that is suitable for a particular scenario or use-case. For example, a notification bot is suitable for sending notifications but not to chat.

- **Build message extension Teams app**: Build a search-based message extension Teams app.

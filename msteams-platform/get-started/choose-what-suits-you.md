# Choose what suits you

You've built your first tab app, interactive notification bot, and message extension. You can build a Teams app as per your app's requirements. Based on factors such as business needs, development environment, and domain knowledge, select the environment and tools to build your app.

A Teams app offers you the flexibility of choosing your build environment. It includes tools, framework, and languages to approach your app development. Build your Teams app in the environment that's best suited for your app. You can even select a combination. For example, you can use Teams Toolkit to build an app with JavaScript and host it on a SharePoint site.

This section takes you through the various options for building your Teams app.

* [Teams collaborative platform](#teams-collaborative-platform)
* [Tools and SDKs](#tools-and-sdks)

## Teams collaborative platform

As a collaborative platform for building apps, Teams offers the full range of apps and tools. Teams platform supports your app development at every stage from planning to distributing it.

You can use various tools and services to build your app. Following is an example development flow.

1. Plan your project and figure out the requirement.
1. Design your app. Use Teams UI Kit and UI Library for designing tabs UI.
1. Build your app with JavaScript using Teams Toolkit.
1. Extend functionality by adding more Teams capabilities, send activity feed notifications, and use Microsoft 365 data with :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph.
1. Test the app on a developer tenant with sample user data.
1. Deploy the app to Azure.
1. Manage and publish the app to Microsoft Teams Store with Developer Portal. Monetize your app with options, such as SaaS offers, in-app purchases, and more.

## Tools and SDKs

You can build your Microsoft Teams app with the help of the following tools and SDKs.

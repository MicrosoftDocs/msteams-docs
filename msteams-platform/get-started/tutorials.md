## Debug your AI chat bot using Microsoft 365 Agents Playground

<details>
<summary><b>Tutorial: Debug your AI chat bot</b></summary>

### Prerequisites

Start Microsoft Teams app development with your Teams AI chat bot app and debug with Microsoft 365 Agents Playground (previously known as Teams App Test Tool). Agents Playground makes debugging bot-based apps effortless. You don't need a Microsoft 365 developer account, tunneling, or Teams app and bot registration to use Agents Playground.

You can chat with your bot and view the messages and Adaptive Cards as they appear in Teams. You can also mock an activity in Agents Playground using activity triggers.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Agents Playground is available only in v5.4.0 of Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit).
> - Agents Playground is supported only for desktop and web clients.

This step-by-step guide helps you to build an AI chat bot using Agents Toolkit and debug with the Test Tool. You'll see the following output after you've completed this guide, where the user can access and use the AI chat bot:

| [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) or  [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/portal)| First create your OpenAI API key to use OpenAI's GPT. If you want to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must create an Azure OpenAI service.|
| [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |

### Create project workspace for your AI chat bot app

The bot capability of a Teams app creates a chatbot or a conversational bot. It communicates with a web service, facilitating the use of its services. The bot can execute simple, automated tasks such as delivering customer service. You can get weather forecast, make reservations, or any other service offered using a conversational bot.

As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the AI chat bot app.

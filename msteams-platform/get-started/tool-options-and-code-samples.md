# Tool options and code samples

[!INCLUDE [Deprecation note](../includes/deprecation-note-teamsfx-sdk.md)]

You've built your first tab app, interactive notification bot, and message extension. You can build a Teams app as per your app's requirements. Based on factors such as business needs, development environment, and domain knowledge, select the environment and tools to build your app.

A Teams app offers you the flexibility of choosing your build environment. It includes tools, framework, and languages to approach your app development. Build your Teams app in the environment that's best suited for your app. You can even select a combination. For example, you can use Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit) to build an app with JavaScript and host it on a SharePoint site.

This section takes you through the various options for building your Teams app.

* [Teams collaborative platform](#teams-collaborative-platform)
* [Tools and SDKs](#tools-and-sdks)
* [Teams app tutorials and code samples](#teams-app-tutorials-and-code-samples)

## Teams collaborative platform

As a collaborative platform for building apps, Teams offers the full range of apps and tools. Teams platform supports your app development at every stage from planning to distributing it.

You can use various tools and services to build your app. Following is an example development flow.

1. Plan your project and figure out the requirement.
1. Design your app. Use Teams UI Kit and Fluent UI React components for designing tabs UI.
1. Build your app with JavaScript using Agents Toolkit.
1. Extend functionality by adding more Teams capabilities, send activity feed notifications, and use Microsoft 365 data with :::image type="icon" source="../assets/icons/graph-small-icon.png"::: Microsoft Graph.
1. Test the app on a developer tenant with sample user data.
1. Deploy the app to Azure.
1. Manage and publish the app to Microsoft Teams Store with Developer Portal. Monetize your app with options, such as SaaS offers, in-app purchases, and more.

## Tools and SDKs

You can build your Microsoft Teams app with the help of the following tools and SDKs.
<!--

-->

To start building your Teams app, you can select the tools and SDKs based on your app requirements.

1. **App capabilities**: You can choose a single or a combination of capabilities based on your app requirements.
1. **SDKs you need**: For example, if you're building AI capability for your bot app, you select Teams AI library.
1. **UI  Components**: Choose the UI components to design your app based on your app capability.
1. **Languages**: Choose the language in which you want to build your app.
1. **Recommended Tools**: Choose the tools based on the language that you've selected. You can also use Developer Portal to manage and publish your app. Agents Toolkit allows you to build your app with JavaScript and TypeScript or with C# in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Visual Studio.

| App capabilities | User interactions | Recommended tools | SDKs | Languages |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Tabs** | A full-screen embedded web experience. | VS Code or Visual Studio with Agents Toolkit extension, or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](../toolkit/Microsoft-365-Agents-Toolkit-CLI.md) (previously known as TeamsFx CLI) if you prefer using CLI | [Teams JavaScript client library](/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client#microsoft-teams-javascript-client-library) for UI functionalities, SharePoint Framework (SPFx), and Microsoft Graph SDK | C#, TypeScript, and JavaScript (including React) |
| **Bots** | A chat bot that converses with members. |VS Code or Visual Studio with Agents Toolkit extension, or [Agents Toolkit CLI](../toolkit/Microsoft-365-Agents-Toolkit-CLI.md) if you prefer using CLI | [TeamsFx SDK](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teamsfx), [Bot Framework SDK](https://dev.botframework.com/), [Teams AI library](../bots/how-to/teams-conversational-ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview.md), and Microsoft Graph SDK | C#, TypeScript, and JavaScript |
| **Message extensions** | Shortcuts for inserting external content into a conversation or taking action on messages. | VS Code or Visual Studio with Agents Toolkit extension, or [Agents Toolkit CLI](../toolkit/Microsoft-365-Agents-Toolkit-CLI.md) if you prefer using CLI | [TeamsFx SDK](/javascript/api/@microsoft/teamsfx), [Bot Framework SDK](https://dev.botframework.com/), [Teams AI library](../bots/how-to/teams-conversational-ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview.md), and Microsoft Graph SDK | C#, TypeScript, and JavaScript |

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Meeting and calls can deliver a user experience for enabling collaboration, partnership, informed communication, and shared feedback. For more information, see [apps for Teams meetings and calls](../apps-in-teams-meetings/teams-apps-in-meetings.md).
> * You can also use languages, such as Node.js, Java, Python, and Web technology like HTML and CSS to build your Teams app.

**Example scenario**: If you want to build a social media dashboard app that sends notifications using TypeScript, consider the following scenario:

# Get started developing apps for Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a service within Office 365. All users of Teams can install apps from the Store, but you will need to go through special steps to develop and test your apps before they are ready to be added to the store.

You can think of Teams as a single page web application. Most of the content you see in Teams actually comes from the Office 365 servers that support your enterprise. This makes it easy for Teams to access other web-based content and display it in the teams app. At their core, apps for Teams are similar to web services, hosted on third-party web servers.

Because of this, it is easy to publish and update apps, but there is additional planning needed when you are starting out developing an app. The biggest issue is where you host your app during development, and how Teams connects with that app. You can host your app:

* On your local development machine
* Using a free service like glitch
* Using a public facing web server or Azure App Service

These options will be discussed in more detail later.

Here are some simple steps to create a Node.js Teams app and test it in Teams.

    Microsoft Teams app that requires device permissions, such as location, camera, or microphone access, now requires users to manually grant permission in the web browser. Previously, the browser handled how to grant access permissions, but now these permissions are handled in Teams.

    This step-by-step guide helps you grant tab device permission in Teams. You can see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

 
    *| &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and call-all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
    
      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

     Use ngrok or Command Prompt to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

     ```bash
     ngrok http --host-header=localhost 3000
     ``` 
       > [!TIP]
       > If you encounter **ERR_NGROK_4018**, follow the steps, as displayed in the Command Prompt to sign up and authenticate ngrok. Then run the `ngrok http --host-header=localhost 3000` command.

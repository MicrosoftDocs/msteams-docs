    This tutorial shows how to create a custom engine agent with Teams AI library using Teams Toolkit to chat with your data on Azure OpenAI. Teams AI library streamlines the process of building intelligent Teams apps by using the AI components and Large Language Models (LLMs) of your choice.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

    * How to set up your data on Azure OpenAI.
    * How to create a new custom engine agent with Teams Toolkit.
    * How to interact with your LLMs and data.
    * The directory structure of your custom engine agent.

   Ensure you install the following tools for building and deploying your apps:

   | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | &nbsp; | [Teams Toolkit](~/toolkit/install-Teams-Toolkit.md) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest version. |
   | &nbsp; | [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
   | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
   | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |
   | &nbsp; | [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/portal)| OpenAI's GPT. Ensure that you first create your OpenAI API key. To host your app or access resources in Azure, you must create an Azure OpenAI service. |

    After you set up your project workspace with Teams Toolkit, you need to create an Azure OpenAI key using Azure portal.

    ## Create an Azure AI Search endpoint and OpenAI key

    1. Go to [**Azure portal**](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) and create an Azure OpenAI service resource. For more information, see [create a resource](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal#create-a-resource).

    1. Go to home page and select the Azure OpenAI service that you created.

    1. Select **Go to Azure OpenAI Studio**.

    1. Select **Chat** > **Create new deployment**.
        
       Update the values for the following fields:

       * **Select a model**: gpt-35-turbo
       * **Model version**: Autoupdate to default
       * **Deployment type**: Standard
       * **Deployment name**: gpt-35-turbo
       * **Content Filter**: default

    1. Select **Create**.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/deploy-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the new deploy model in Azure portal.":::     

    1. Select **Chat** > **Add a data source**.
     
    1. From the dropdown, select **Upload files (preview)**.

    1. Select **Create a new Azure Blob storage resource** and follow the onscreen instructions.
     
    1. Select **Create a new Azure AI Search resource** and follow the onscreen instructions.
     
    1. Select the newly created Azure Blob storage and Azure AI Search from the dropdown.
     
        > [!NOTE]
        > Save **Azure AI Search endpoint** and **key** details as they're necessary for the subsequent steps.

    1. Enter a unique **index name** and select **Next**.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/nba.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to create data source in Azure portal.":::

    1. Select **Browse for a file** and upload files you prefer to use as your data, then select **Upload files**.

         > [!NOTE]
         > Files must be in `.txt`, `.md`, `.html`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.pptx` format with 16-MB size limit.

    1. Select the **Data management** settings as default and select **Next**.
     
    1. Select **Save and close**.

     After the data ingestion process is complete, you can start creating your custom engine agent using Teams AI library and Teams Toolkit.

   Now that you have created your Azure OpenAI key and endpoints, let's create a new custom engine agent using Teams Toolkit.

    ## Create a new custom engine agent using Teams Toolkit

    1. Go to **Visual Studio Code**.

    1. Select the Teams Toolkit :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png"::: icon in the Visual Studio Code Activity Bar.

    1. Select **Create a New App**.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/create-a-new-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to create a new app in Visual Studio Code.":::     

    1. Select **Custom Engine Agent**.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/custom-copilot.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows custom engine agent option in Visual Studio Code.":::

    1. Select **Basic AI Chatbot**.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/basic-ai-chatbot.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows basic ai chatbot in Visual Studio Code.":::

    1. Select **JavaScript** as the programming language.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/programming-language.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows programming language in Visual Studio Code.":::     

    1. Select **Azure OpenAI**.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/large-language-model.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows LLM in Visual Studio Code.":::     

    1. Enter the values from the Azure portal:
     
         * **Azure OpenAI key**

         * **Azure OpenAI endpoint**

         * **Deployment name**

    1. Alternatively, you can fill in these details later in the `env/.env.testtool.user` file once your custom engine agent is created.

    1. Select a folder that contains the root folder of your project and enter a suitable name for your custom engine agent.
     
    1. Select **Enter**. Custom engine agent is created in a few seconds.

- title: Configure your custom engine agent
  durationInMinutes: 1

   After you create your custom engine agent, let's configure it to interact with your data on Azure OpenAI.

    ## Configure and debug your custom engine agent

    Let's customize the prompt for your custom engine agent.

    1. Go to `src/prompts/chat/skprompt.txt` and update the following code in `skprompt.txt` file:

        ```skprompt.txt
        The following is a conversation with an AI assistant, who is an expert on answering questions over the given context.
        Responses should be in a short journalistic style with no more than 80 words. 
        ```
        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/prompts-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows skprompt in explorer in Visual Studio Code.":::

    1. Go to the `config.json` file under `prompts/chat`. Add the following code inside the `completion` brackets and replace the `endpoint`, `index_name`, and `key` values with your Azure AI Search resource details:

        ```json
           "data_sources": [
             {
                    "type": "azure_search",
                    "parameters": {
                         "endpoint": "AZURE-AI-SEARCH-ENDPOINT",
                         "index_name": "YOUR-INDEX_NAME",
                         "authentication": {
                               "type": "api_key",
                               "key": "AZURE-AI-SEARCH-KEY"
                           }
                     }
               }
             ]
        ```

    1. Go to `src/app/app.js` file and add the following variable inside `OpenAIModel`: 

        ```javascript
        azureApiVersion: '2024-02-15-preview'
        ```
 
    1. From the left pane, select **Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)**.

    1. Select **Debug in Test Tool (Preview)**.

       > [!NOTE]
       > If you want to debug in either Teams or Copilot, select **"Debug in Teams** or **Debug in Copilot**.
     
    1. Select the **F5** key.   

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/debug-in-test-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the debug in test tool.":::

    1. Custom engine agent runs within the Teams App Test Tool, which opens in your browser.

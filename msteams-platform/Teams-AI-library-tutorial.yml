    This tutorial shows how to create a custom engine agent using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit) with OpenAI.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

    * How to create a new custom engine agent with Agents Toolkit.
    * How to interact with your LLMs and data.
    * The directory structure of your custom engine agent.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > * Custom engine agents are supported only in personal chats, group chats, and meetings.
    > * Custom engine agent support for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is available only in [public developer preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro?tabs=new-teams-client).
    > * Custom engine agent isn't supported in Python.

   Ensure you install the following tools for building and deploying your apps:

   | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | &nbsp; | [Agents Toolkit](~/toolkit/install-Teams-Toolkit.md) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest version. |
   | &nbsp; | [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
   | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
   | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |
   | &nbsp; |[OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application) |First create your OpenAI API key to use OpenAI's GPT. If you want to host your app or access resources in Microsoft Azure, you must create an [Azure OpenAI service](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) before you begin.|

   After you create your custom engine agent, let's configure it.

    ## Configure and debug your custom engine agent

    Let's customize the prompt for your custom engine agent.

    1. Go to `src/prompts/chat/skprompt.txt` and update the following code in `skprompt.txt` file:

        ```skprompt.txt
        The following is a conversation with an AI assistant, who is an expert on answering questions over the given context.
        Responses should be in a short journalistic style with no more than 80 words. 
        ```
        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/prompts-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows skprompt in explorer in Visual Studio Code.":::
 
    1. From the left pane, select **Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)**.

    1. Select **Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground**.

       > [!NOTE]
       > If you want to debug in either Teams or Copilot, select **"Debug in Teams** or **Debug in Copilot**.
     
    1. Select the **F5** key.   

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/bots/debug-in-test-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the debug in Agents Playground.":::

    1. Custom engine agent runs within Agents Playground, which opens in your browser.

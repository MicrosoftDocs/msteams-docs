   The  Microsoft Entra single sign-on (Microsoft Entra SSO) helps to authenticate users in Teams. 

   **Key aspects of Microsoft Entra SSO**:

    * Allows the user to sign in automatically after the first sign in.
    * Allows the user to sign in to other devices without entering credentials again.
    * Obtains token for the signed in user.

   This step-by-step guide helps you to create tabs and message extensions enabling Microsoft Entra SSO authentication. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

    | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and calls all in one place.|
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) | Customized bindings for local debugging and Azure Functions app deployments. If you haven't installed the latest version, install the portable version. |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
     | &nbsp; | Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later. <br> or </br> You can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |

      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

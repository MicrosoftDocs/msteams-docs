    Teams bots are conversational bots that run repetitive automated tasks done by the users, such as customer service. The user needs to sign in with their credentials multiple times for performing repetitive tasks. The Single sign-on (SSO) authentication method in Azure Active Directory silently refreshes the authentication token, which results in reduction of the number of times users need to enter their sign-in credentials. 
    
    A bot behaves differently depending on the conversation it's involved in:

    * Bots in channel and group chat conversations require the user to @mention the bot.
    * Bots in a one-to-one conversation don't require an @mention. All messages sent by the user routes to the bot.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to create a bot with SSO authentication enabled. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

    * Active Microsoft Teams account with profile picture

      > [!TIP]
      > Ensure the Microsoft Teams account isn't a guest account.

    * [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution

      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    * Visual Studio 2019 or the latest version
    * [Microsoft 365 developer account](concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md) or access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app

- title: Set up bot in Azure Bot Service
  durationInMinutes: 5
  content: |
    To authenticate the bot with SSO, you can set up bot in Azure Bot Service. Register bot with Azure Bot Service when you develop and host it in Azure. Perform the following steps:

    * Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your web server's endpoints.
    * Create Azure Bot resource to register bot with Azure Bot Service.
    * Create client secret that enables SSO authentication of the bot.
    * Add Microsoft Teams channel to deploy the bot to a Teams channel.
    * Add messaging endpoint to the ngrok tunnel you created.

    Use ngrok to create a tunnel to your locally running web server's publicly available HTTPS endpoints. Run the following command in ngrok:

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

    **To create Azure Bot resource**

    1. Go to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Select **Create a resource**.
    1. In the search box, enter **Azure bot** and select the Enter key.
    1. Select **Azure Bot**.

        ![Create Azure bot card](~/assets/images/bots/createazurebot.png)

- title: Configure and run the Teams app
  durationInMinutes: 2
  content: |
    The most comprehensive way to test your bot is by creating an app package and uploading it to Teams. This method is the only way to test the full functionality available to your bot, across all scopes. You can configure and run the Teams app by uploading the `manifest.zip` file.

    **To run the Teams app by uploading the manifest.zip file**
    
    1. In Visual Studio, go to the `appPackage/` folder.
    1. Open the `manifest.json` file.
    1. In the `manifest.json` file, find **{TODO: MicrosoftAppId}** and replace it with your Microsoft App ID.
    1. In Windows Explorer, go to the **Microsoft-Teams-Samples > samples > bot-conversation-sso-quickstart > csharp_dotnetcore > appPackage** folder.
    1. Zip the contents of the `appPackage/` folder to create `manifest.zip`.
    1. Go to Teams.
    1. To upload `manifest.zip`, select **Store > Manage your apps > Upload a custom app** and open `manifest.zip`.
    1. Select **Add** to add the conversation bot to your chat.

        You can interact with this bot by sending it a message. The Bot exchanges an SSO token and makes a call to the Graph API on your behalf and returns the results. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to **logout**.

    1. Send a message to the bot. The conversation bot asks for permissions for the first time.

        ![Permissions to bot](~/assets/images/bots/sbsdesktop-mobile-consent-request.png)

    1. Select **Continue** to accept the permissions.

    1. Select **Accept** for **Permissions requested**.

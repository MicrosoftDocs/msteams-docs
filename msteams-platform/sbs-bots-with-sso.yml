    Microsoft Teams bots are conversational bots that run repetitive automated tasks done by the users, such as customer service. The user needs to sign in multiple times without single sign-on (SSO) authentication. With SSO authentication methods, the users don't need to sign in to the bot multiple times.
    
    A bot behaves differently depending on the conversation it's involved in:

    * Bots in channel and group chat conversations require the users to @mention the bot.
    * Bots in a one-to-one conversation don't require an @mention. All messages sent by the user routes to the bot.
    
    This step-by-step guide helps you to build a bot with SSO authentication. You'll see the following output:

    Ensure you install the following tools and set up your development environment:  

     | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
     | --- | --- | --- |
     | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft Teams with an account (not a guest account)](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) |  Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, calls, and all in one place. |
     | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com)<br> Install one of the following two workloads:<br> • ASP.NET and web development <br> • .NET Core cross-platform development | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the workloads. |
     | &nbsp; | [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
     | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |

      > [!NOTE]
      > After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also sideload and test the app.

    ### Check for sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This loading is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Sideloading is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable Sideloading to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    To verify sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Apps**.
    1. Select **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app**.
    1. Look for the option **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/bots/upload-custom-app1_1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Teams app with the Upload an app dialog. The menu entry titled Upload a custom app is highlighted in red.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you don't have the option to upload a custom app, contact Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. Select **Setup E5 subscription** from the welcome screen.
    1. Set up administrator account. After you finish, the following screen displays.

          :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the new administrator account. Now you should have the **Upload a custom app** option.

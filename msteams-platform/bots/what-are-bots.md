# Build bots for Teams

A bot is also referred to as a chatbot or conversational bot. It's an app that runs simple and repetitive tasks by users such as customer service or support staff. Everyday use of bots include, bots that provide information about the weather, make dinner reservations, or provide travel information. Interactions with bots can be quick questions and answers or complex conversations.

It's recommended to start with [build your first bot app using JavaScript](../sbs-gs-bot.yml) or [build notification bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml) by using the new generation development tool for Teams. For more information, see [Teams Toolkit overview](../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md).

Bot applications within Microsoft Teams for GCC-High and DOD are available through [Azure bot Service](/azure/bot-service/how-to-deploy-gov-cloud-high) and bot channel registration must be done in Azure Government portal.

Conversational bots allow users to interact with your web service using text, interactive cards, and dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x).

Conversational bots are incredibly flexible. Bots can handle a few basic commands or complex tasks that involve artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Bots can be part of a larger application or be standalone.

Use the right mix of cards, text, and dialogs to create a useful bot. The following image shows a user conversing with a bot in a one-to-one chat using text and interactive cards.

Every interaction between the user and the bot is represented as an activity. When a bot receives an activity, it passes it on to its activity handlers. See [bot activity handlers](~/bots/bot-basics.md).

Bots are apps that have a conversational interface. You can interact with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot behaves differently in a channel or group chat conversation and in a one-to-one conversation. Conversations are handled through the Bot Framework connector. See [conversation basics](~/bots/how-to/conversations/conversation-basics.md).

Your bot requires contextual information, such as user profile details to access relevant content and enhance the bot experience. See [get Teams context](~/bots/how-to/get-teams-context.md).

You can send and receive files through the bot using Graph APIs or Teams bot APIs. See [send and receive files through the bot](~/bots/how-to/bots-filesv4.md).

Rate limiting is used to optimize bots used for your Teams application. To protect Teams and its users, the bot APIs provide a rate limit for incoming requests. See [optimize your bot with rate limiting in Teams](~/bots/how-to/rate-limit.md).

With Microsoft Graph APIs for calls and online meetings, Teams apps can now interact with users using voice and video. See [calls and meetings bots](~/bots/calls-and-meetings/calls-meetings-bots-overview.md).

You can use the Teams bot APIs to get information for members of a chat or team. See [changes to Teams bot APIs for fetching team or chat members](~/resources/team-chat-member-api-changes.md).

You can change the bot name displayed in Teams environment, and you need to update it in the following occurrences:

* The bot name displayed as a title in the chat window is managed within your app manifest (previously called Teams app manifest) and you can update the bot name in your app manifest.

* The bot name that's displayed in your Teams chat list and in the chat window with each message are managed within Microsoft Azure portal. For custom uploaded apps, you can update the bot name in the **Bot profile** page in Azure portal.

## Add SSO authentication to your conversation bots

You can add single sign-on authentication to your conversation bot using the following steps:

* [Create Teams conversation bot](../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml)
* [Configure your bot app in Microsoft Entra ID](~/bots/how-to/authentication/bot-sso-register-aad.md)

## Bot configuration experience

Bot configuration experience helps you to enable the bot settings for users to configure their bot during installation and reconfigure the bot from the channel or group chat scope where the bot is installed. Bot configuration is an important functionality for apps within the Teams platform, laying the foundation for their operational effectiveness. For more information, see [bot configuration experience](how-to/bot-configuration-experience.md).

# Bot overview

Bots are software applications that interact with users through text-based conversations. Bots follow predefined rules to answer questions or execute specific tasks. AI-powered bots use artificial intelligence to understand natural language, conduct complex conversations, and handle multiple functions. Bots range from basic scripts to advanced AI systems that learn and adapt over time. You build Teams bots as virtual assistants in Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365.

Bot apps offer a range of business advantages:

1. **Automation**: Bots handle repetitive tasks, saving you time and effort.
2. **Availability**: Bots operate round-the-clock without needing breaks.
3. **Efficiency**: Bots manage multiple tasks simultaneously, improving overall performance.
4. **Customer engagement**: Bots interact with customers and provide instant responses and support.
5. **Scalability**: Bots scale to handle more tasks or interactions as user needs evolve.

## How do bots work?

A Teams bot operates by following a set of rules or using AI to understand and respond to user requests. When a user sends a message, the bot processes the input, determines the user's need, and then provides a response or performs an action.

Here is an example of a simple bot on Teams that accepts short commands from a user:

### Bots - the developer experience

A developer builds a bot to automate repetitive tasks, enhance efficiency, and improve user engagement. The following image illustrates how you build a bot app that meets user requirements:

### Understand bot development basics

This section explains common bot elements and how they interact to create an effective bot within Teams.

* **Activity handler**: This component manages and processes events or activities generated by user interactions. These activities include text or image messages, bot events like users joining or leaving, @mentions, user actions such as booking or ordering through the bot, and error management.
* **Event**: This occurrence triggers when a user interacts with a bot. An event prompts the bot to respond or take action. For example, an event triggers when a user sends a message, clicks a button, or shares an input.
* **Conversation**: This interactive exchange involves a user and a bot. A conversation includes text or voice messaging, user inputs, the bot's responses, contextual history and state, the user's intent, and a dialog that may extend over multiple turns.
* **Bot logic**: This critical element defines the decision-making process within the conversation. It works with the activity handler to integrate rules, conditions, and factors that determine the bot's responses.
* **Bot scope**: This defines the bot's functionalities and interactions within Microsoft Teams. You deploy a bot in Teams as a personal chatbot, within a group chat, or within a channel.

### Explore bot capabilities

You choose one or more capabilities for your bot app. You use either the Bot Framework SDK or the Teams AI library with Teams Toolkit to implement these capabilities in your bot.

* **Custom engine agent**: A custom engine agent is a bot that uses AI to perform automated tasks. It understands natural language, engages in conversations, and answers questions. Developers use it for virtual assistance, language translation, predictive analysis, and more. Custom engine agents, which are AI-enabled Teams bots, build on custom AI models of choice.

  For more information, see [how to build a custom engine agent](../Teams-AI-library-tutorial.yml).

* **Conventional bots**:

  * **Conversational bot**:  
    A conversational bot simulates human-like interactions, enabling users to engage with a web service through text, interactive cards, and dialogs. It understands user inputs and responds accordingly. These bots serve virtual assistance, customer service, and other similar functions.

    For more information, see [how to create Teams conversation bot](../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

  * **Notification bot**:  
    A notification bot automatically sends alerts to users in Teams channels, group chats, or personal chats. You use a notification bot for sending reminders, alerts, or updates. Users interact with the bot by responding to options, links within the notification, or by providing feedback.

    For more information, see [how to build notification bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml).

  * **Workflow bot**:  
    A workflow bot streamlines business processes by automating interactions across users, applications, and data to manage tasks and workflows. Developers use a workflow bot to automate repetitive tasks, assign work, and track progress. This bot improves overall efficiency by reducing manual effort.

    For more information, see [how to build workflow bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-workflow-bot.yml).

  * **Command bot**:  
    A command bot automates responses for simple commands in a chat. With Teams Toolkit, you create a command bot template that displays the UI using an Adaptive Card.

    For more information, see [build command bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-commandbot.yml).

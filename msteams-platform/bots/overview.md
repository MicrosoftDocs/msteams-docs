# Bot overview

Bots are software applications that interact with users through text-based conversations. Simple bots follow predefined rules to answer questions or provide basic support. AI-powered bots, however, use artificial intelligence to understand natural language, engage in complex conversations, and perform a wider range of tasks.

Teams bots can be built as virtual assistants within Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365, with or without AI, to enhance productivity by automating tasks, providing constant support, and enhancing customer engagement.

Bot apps offer a range of business advantages:

1. Automation: Bots can handle repetitive tasks, saving you time and effort.
1. Availability: Bots can work round-the-clock without needing breaks.
1. Efficiency: They can manage multiple tasks simultaneously, improving overall efficiency.
1. Customer Engagement: Bots can interact with customers and provide instant responses and support.
1. Scalability: As user needs grow, bots can be easily scaled to handle more tasks or interactions.

## How do bots work?

A Teams bot works by following a set of rules or using AI to understand and respond to your requests. When you send a message to a bot, it processes your input, determines what you need, and then provides a response or performs an action.

Here's an example of a simple bot on Teams that takes short commands from a user:

### Bots - the developer experience

Let's consider an example: As a developer, you must build a bot to automate repetitive tasks and enhance efficiency and user engagement. The following image shows how a developer can build a bot app to meet the user requirements:

### Understand bot development basics

Let's learn about some common bot elements and how they work together to make a bot effective within Teams.

* **Activity handler**: This component manages, and processes events or activities generated by users interacting with the bot. These activities can include text or image messages, bot events like users joining or leaving, @mentions, user actions such as booking or ordering through the bot and handling errors.
* **Events**: These are occurrences triggered when a user interacts with a bot. An event can make a bot respond or take action. For example, events can occur when the user sends a message, clicks a button, or shares some input.
* **Conversation**: This is an interactive exchange between a user and a bot. A conversation can include text or voice messaging. It involves user inputs, the bot's responses, the context of the conversation such as history and state, the intent of the conversation (the user's goal or purpose), and dialog that can be a multi-turn exchange.
* **Bot logic**: It's a key part of conversation logic. It works alongside the activity handler to define how decisions are made. This includes integrating rules, conditions, and other factors to determine how the bot should respond.
* **Bot scope**: This refers to what a bot can do and how it interacts with users within Microsoft Teams. A bot can be deployed in Teams in three ways: as a personal chatbot, within a group chat, or within a channel.

### Explore bot capabilities

You can choose one or more of the following capabilities for your bot app. Use either Bot Framework SDK or Teams AI library with Teams Toolkit to build these capabilities in your bot.

* **Custom engine agent**: A custom engine agent is a bot that uses artificial intelligence to perform automated tasks. They understand natural language, can engage in conversations, and answer questions. You can use them for virtual assistance, language translation, predictive analysis, and more. Custom engine agents, which are AI-enabled Teams bots, can be built using custom AI models of your choice.

  For more information, see [build a custom engine agent to chat with your data using Teams AI library and Teams Toolkit](../Teams-AI-library-tutorial.yml).

* **AI bot**:
  An AI bot uses artificial intelligence to perform the tasks it is automated to do. It understands natural language and can engage in conversation and answer questions. You can use it for virtual assistance, language translation, predictive analysis, and more. You can build the following types of bots:

  * Teams AI bot: Teams AI bot is integrated within Microsoft Teams and utilizes Microsoft Teams AI library and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
  * Custom engine agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot: This is a custom engine copilot is an AI-powered bot. It's built using custom AI models. You can integrate a custom engine copilot for Microsoft 365 Copilot with various systems.

  For more information, see [build a custom engine agent to chat with your data using Teams AI library and Teams Toolkit](../Teams-AI-library-tutorial.yml).

* **Conventional bots**:

  * **Conversational bot**:
    A conversational bot is a chat bot that can simulate conversation with users, who can use it to interact with a web service. The conversation is made possible through text, interactive cards, and dialogs. This bot can understand user inputs and respond accordingly. You can use it to help users with virtual assistance, customer service, and more.

    For more information, see [create Teams conversation bot](../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

  * **Notification bot**:
    A notification bot is an automated bot that sends notifications to users in a Teams channel, group chat, or personal chat. You can use notification bots for user scenarios such as sending reminders or alerts, or sharing news or updates. Users can also interact with interactive notification bots by responding to options or links within the notification or even sharing input or feedback.

      For more information, see [build notification bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml).

  * **Workflow bot**:
    You use a workflow bot to automate or streamline business processes. This bot can interact with users, applications, and data to progress tasks and workflows. You can use workflow bots to automate repetitive tasks, assign tasks to team members, track progress, and more. They're used to bring efficiency through automation and reduction of manual effort.

    For more information, see [build command bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-workflow-bot.yml).

  * **Command bot**:
    Use a command bot to automate responses for simple commands in a chat. With Teams Toolkit, you can easily create a command bot template that displays the UI using an Adaptive Card.

    For more information, see [Build command bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-commandbot.yml).

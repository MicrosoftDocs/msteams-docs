# Build a bot with SSO authentication

Conversational bots in Microsoft Teams perform repetitive automated tasks initiated by users, such as customer service. The user needs to sign in multiple times without single sign-on (SSO) authentication. With SSO authentication methods, the users don't need to sign in to the bot multiple times.

A bot behaves differently depending on the conversation it's involved in:

* Bots in channel and group chat conversations require the users to @mention the bot. 
* Bots in a one-to-one conversation don't require an @mention. All messages sent by the user routes to the bot.
  
This step-by-step guide helps you to build a bot with SSO authentication. You'll see the following output:

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you install the following tools and set up your development environment:

| **Install** | **For using...** |
|-------------|------------------|
| [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Microsoft Teams to collaborate with everyone you work with through apps for chat, meetings, and calls all in one place. |
| [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) | You can install the enterprise version in Visual Studio 2022, and install the ASP.NET and web development workloads. Use the latest version. |
| [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app. |
| Dev tunnel | Teams app features (conversational bots, message extensions, and incoming webhooks) need inbound connections. A tunnel connects your development system to Teams. Dev tunnel is a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access. Dev tunnel is available in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7.0 or later.<br>Or you can also use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as a tunnel to connect your development system to Teams. It isn't required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |

 > [!NOTE]
> After downloading ngrok, sign up and install [authtoken](https://ngrok.com/download).

### Set up your Teams development tenant

A tenant is like a space or a container where you chat, share files, and run meetings for your organization in Teams. You can also upload and test the custom app.

### Check for custom app upload option

After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom app upload is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. Enable app upload to preview and test your app in Teams locally.

Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

To verify custom upload apps in Teams:

1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps** icon.
2. Select **Manage your apps**.
3. Select **Upload an app**
4. Look for the option **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, custom app upload is enabled.

![Screenshot showing the Teams apps, Manage your apps, Upload an app, and Upload a custom app highlighted in red.](../assets/images/bots/upload-a-custom-app-sso-bot-authentication.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Contact Teams administrator, if you don't have the option to upload a custom app.

### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it for free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
2. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
3. In the welcome screen, select **Setup E5 subscription**.
4. Set up an administrator account. After you finish, the following screen displays.

![Screenshot of the Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription.](../assets/images/toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png)

5. Sign in to Teams using the new administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

## Register Microsoft Entra app

The following steps help you to create and register your bot in the Azure portal:

* Create and register your Azure app. 
* Create client secret to enable SSO authentication of the bot.
* Add Teams channel to deploy the bot.
* Create a tunnel to your web server's endpoints using dev tunnel (recommended) or ngrok.
* Add messaging endpoint to the dev tunnel that you created.

You can interact with the bot by sending it a message. The bot exchanges an SSO token and calls the Graph API on your behalf. It keeps you signed in unless you send a message to sign out.

1. Send a message to the bot. The conversation bot asks for consent for the first time.

a. For desktop: Select **Continue** to give permissions to Teams client for accessing the bot.

> [!NOTE]
> Now youâ€™ve configured SSO with your bot app and it's the only time you'll have to give consent.

1. For mobile: Select **Accept**.

> [!NOTE]
> Now youâ€™ve configured SSO with your bot app in mobile, and it's the only time you'll have to give consent.

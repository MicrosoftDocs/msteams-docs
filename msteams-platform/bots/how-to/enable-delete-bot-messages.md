# Enable users to delete bot messages

You can now enable bot users to delete bot messages in a group chat. As a developer, when you enable deleting bot messgaes for users, they'll be able to delete Group Copilot bot messages in chat threads to remove unintended or sensitive content. All users in any chat can delete messages using the ‘Delete’ option in the overflow menu.

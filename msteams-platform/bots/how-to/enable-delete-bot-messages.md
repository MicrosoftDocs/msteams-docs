# Enable users to delete bot messages

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling deleting bot message for bot app user is available only in [public developer preview for Teams.](../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

Bot users can now delete bot messages in group chats. Developers can enable this feature, allowing users to remove Group Copilot bot messages. You can enable bot users to delete bot message to:

- **Protect unintended content**: Users can delete bot messages to eliminate unintended or sensitive content to ensure confidential information remains protected.
- **Remove incorrect information**: Users can delete messages that contain inaccurate or erroneous information.
- **Improve user experience**: Users can delete excessive error logs generated by the bot, maintaining a clean chat environment.

Deleting messages helps maintain a clean chat environment and protects sensitive information.

## Delete bot message user experience

All users in any chat can delete messages in the following scopes:

- Personal
- Group chat
- Channel
- Meeting chat

If a bot's response is inaccurate or compromises sensitive information, any user can delete the bot using the overflow **Delete** option. Here are some examples of user experience in personal and group chat for desktop and mobile client:

# [Deleting messages in mobile device](#tab/mobile2)

After a message is deleted:

- The bot app prompts users to submit feedback with the reason for deleting a bot message. If the reason is an incorrect bot response, the feedback helps improve bot performance.
- The deleted message is removed for all users and doesn't appear in searches.
- An indication replaces the deleted message as shown in the following example:

  :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/message-delete-undo.png" alt-text="Image shows the indication of deleted message and the Undo option.":::

- Bot app users can undo deletions in case a message was deleted by mistake. However, the **Undo** option is available for a limited time.
- The mobile client offers a consistent user experience with the desktop client.

## Enable users to delete bot messages in your bot app

To enable the users to delete bot messages, you need to:

- [Update app manifest](#update-app-manifest)
- [Enable users to delete message in Admin Center](#enable-users-to-delete-bot-messages-in-admin-center)

### Update app manifest

Allowing bot users to delete messages is optional. To enable this feature for your bot app, update the app manifest as follows:

1. Open the app manifest file.
1. Update the `allowBotMessageDeleteByUser` property in the `manifest.json` to `true`.

    The following code snippet shows an example of app manifest update:

    ```json
    { 
      id: "Id", 
      name: "Contoso", 
      largeImageUrl: "Contoso", 
      validDomains: null, 
      externalId: null, 
      bots: [{ 
            id: "bot-id", 
            "scopes": [
                "personal",
                "groupChat"
            ], 
            capabilities: { 
              __typename: "BotCapabilities", 
              isNotificationOnly: true, 
              supportsFiles: false, 
            }, 
        allowBotMessageDeleteByUser: true
        }],
      manifestVersion: null, 
    }   
    ```

1. Save the updates and upload the app package to test the functionality in Teams.

### Enable users to delete bot messages in Admin Center

The Admin must enable bot users to delete messages in the tenant where the bot app is installed.

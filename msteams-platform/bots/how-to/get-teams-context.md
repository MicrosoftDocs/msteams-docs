# Get Teams specific context for your bot

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-bots.md)]

A bot can access additional context data about a team or chat where it is installed. This information can be used to enrich the bot's functionality and provide a more personalized experience.

## Fetch the roster or user profile

Your bot can query for the list of members and their basic user profiles, including Teams user IDs and Azure Active Directory (AAD) information such as name and objectId. You can use this information to correlate user identities. For example, to check whether a user, logged into a tab through AAD credentials, is a member of the team. For get conversation members, minimum or maximum page size depends on the implementation. Page size less than 50, are treated as 50, and page size greater than 500, are capped at 500. Even if you use the non-paged version, it is unreliable in large teams and must not be used. For more information, see [changes to Teams Bot APIs for fetching team or chat members](~/resources/team-chat-member-api-changes.md).

The following sample code uses the paged endpoint for fetching the roster:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
public class MyBot : TeamsActivityHandler
{
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var members = new List<TeamsChannelAccount>();
        string continuationToken = null;

        do
        {
            var currentPage = await TeamsInfo.GetPagedMembersAsync(turnContext, 100, continuationToken, cancellationToken);
            continuationToken = currentPage.ContinuationToken;
            members.AddRange(currentPage.Members);
         }
         while (continuationToken != null);
     }
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();

        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types.
        this.onMessage(async (turnContext, next) => {
            var continuationToken;
            var members = [];

            do {
                var pagedMembers = await TeamsInfo.getPagedMembers(context, 100, continuationToken);
                continuationToken = pagedMembers.continuationToken;
                members.push(...pagedMembers.members);
            }
            while(continuationToken !== undefined)

            // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
            await next();
        });
    }
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
async def _show_members(
    self, turn_context: TurnContext
):
    members = await TeamsInfo.get_team_members(turn_context)
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

You can directly issue a GET request on `/v3/conversations/{conversationId}/pagedmembers?pageSize={pageSize}&continuationToken={continuationToken}`, using the value of `serviceUrl` as the endpoint. The value of `serviceUrl` is stable but can change. When a new message arrives, your bot should verify its stored value for `serviceUrl`. The response payload also indicates if the user is a regular or anonymous user.

```http
GET /v3/conversations/19:meeting_N2QzYTA3YmItYmMwOC00OTJmLThkYzMtZWMzZGU0NGIyZGI0@thread.v2/pagedmembers?pageSize=100&continuationToken=asdfasdfalkdsjfalksjdf

After you fetch the roster or user profile, you can get details of a single member. Currently, to retrieve information for one or more members of a chat or team, use the Microsoft Teams bot APIs `TeamsInfo.GetMembersAsync` for C# or .NET or `TeamsInfo.getMembers` for TypeScript or Node.js APIs.

## Get single member details

You can also retrieve the details of a particular user using their Teams user ID, UPN, or AAD Object ID.

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
public class MyBot : TeamsActivityHandler
{
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var member = await TeamsInfo.GetMemberAsync(turnContext, turnContext.Activity.From.Id, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();

        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types.
        const member = await TeamsInfo.getMember(context, encodeURI('someone@somecompany.com'));

        // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
        await next();
        });
    }
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
async def _show_members(
    self, turn_context: TurnContext
):
    member = TeamsInfo.get_member(turn_context, turn_context.activity.from_property.id)
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

You can directly issue a GET request on `/v3/conversations/{conversationId}/members/{userId}`, using the value of `serviceUrl` as the endpoint. The value of `serviceUrl` is stable but can change. When a new message arrives, your bot must verify its stored value for `serviceUrl`. This can be used for regular users and anonymous users.

Below is a response sample for regular user

```http
GET /v3/conversations/19:ja0cu120i1jod12j@skype.net/members/29:1GcS4EyB_oSI8A88XmWBN7NJFyMqe3QGnJdgLfFGkJnVelzRGos0bPbpsfJjcbAD22bmKc4GMbrY2g4JDrrA8vM06X1-cHHle4zOE6U4ttcc

Response body
{
    "id": "29:1GcS4EyB_oSI8A88XmWBN7NJFyMqe3QGnJdgLfFGkJnVelzRGos0bPbpsfJjcbAD22bmKc4GMbrY2g4JDrrA8vM06X1-cHHle4zOE6U4ttcc",
    "objectId": "9d3e08f9-a7ae-43aa-a4d3-de3f319a8a9c",
    "givenName": "Larry",
    "surname": "Brown",
    "email": "Larry.Brown@fabrikam.com",
    "userPrincipalName": "labrown@fabrikam.com",
    "tenantId":"72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47", 
    "userRole":"user"
}
```

Below is response for anonymous user

```http
GET /v3/conversations/19:ja0cu120i1jod12j@skype.net/members/<anonymous user id>"

Response body
{
    "id": "29:1GcS4EyB_oSI8A88XmWBN7NJFyMqe3QGnJdgLfFGkJnVelzRGos0bPbpsfJjcbAD22bmKc4GMbrY2g4JDrrA8vM06X1-cHHle4zOE6U4ttcc",
    "name": "Anon1 (Guest)",
    "tenantId":"72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47", 
    "userRole":"anonymous"
}
```

After you get details of a single member, you can get details of the team. Currently, to retrieve information for a team, use the Microsoft Teams bot APIs `TeamsInfo.GetMemberDetailsAsync` for C# or .NET or `TeamsInfo.getTeamDetails` for TypeScript or Node.js APIs.

## Get team's details

When installed in a team, your bot can query for metadata about that team including the Azure AD group ID.

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
public class MyBot : TeamsActivityHandler
{
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        TeamDetails teamDetails = await TeamsInfo.GetTeamDetailsAsync(turnContext, turnContext.Activity.TeamsGetTeamInfo().Id, cancellationToken);
        if (teamDetails != null) {
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"The groupId is: {teamDetails.AadGroupId}");
        }
        else {
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"Message did not come from a channel in a team.");
        }
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();

        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types.
        this.onMessage(async (turnContext, next) => {
            const teamDetails = await TeamsInfo.getTeamDetails(turnContext);
            if (teamDetails) {
                await turnContext.sendActivity(`The group ID is: ${teamDetails.aadGroupId}`);
            } else {
                await turnContext.sendActivity('This message did not come from a channel in a team.');
            }

            // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
            await next();
        });
    }
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
async def _show_details(self, turn_context: TurnContext):
    team_details = await TeamsInfo.get_team_details(turn_context)
    reply = MessageFactory.text(f"The team name is {team_details.name}. The team ID is {team_details.id}. The AADGroupID is {team_details.aad_group_id}.")
    await turn_context.send_activity(reply)
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

You can directly issue a GET request on `/v3/teams/{teamId}`, using the value of `serviceUrl` as the endpoint. The value of `serviceUrl` is stable but can change. When a new message arrives, your bot must verify its stored value for `serviceUrl`.

```http
GET /v3/teams/19:ja0cu120i1jod12j@skype.net

Response body
{
    "id": "29:1GcS4EyB_oSI8A88XmWBN7NJFyMqe3QGnJdgLfFGkJnVelzRGos0bPbpsfJjcbAD22bmKc4GMbrY2g4JDrrA8vM06X1-cHHle4zOE6U4ttcc",
    "name": "The Team Name",
    "aadGroupId": "02ce3874-dd86-41ba-bddc-013f34019978"
}
```

After you get details of the team, you can get the list of channels in a team. Currently, to retrieve information for a list of channels in a team, use the Microsoft Teams bot APIs `TeamsInfo.GetTeamChannelsAsync` for C# or .NET or `TeamsInfo.getTeamChannels` for TypeScript or Node.js APIs.

## Get the list of channels in a team

Your bot can query the list of channels in a team.

> [!NOTE]
>* The name of the default General channel is returned as `null` to allow for localization.
>* The channel ID for the General channel always matches the team ID.

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
public class MyBot : TeamsActivityHandler
{
    protected override async Task OnMessageActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IMessageActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        IEnumerable<ChannelInfo> channels = await TeamsInfo.GetTeamChannelsAsync(turnContext, turnContext.Activity.TeamsGetTeamInfo().Id, cancellationToken);

        await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($"The channel count is: {channels.Count()}");
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();

        // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-activity-message to learn more about the message and other activity types.
        this.onMessage(async (turnContext, next) => {
            const channels = await TeamsInfo.getTeamChannels(turnContext);

            await turnContext.sendActivity(`The channel count is: ${channels.length}`);

            // By calling next() you ensure that the next BotHandler is run.
            await next();
        });
    }
}
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
async def _show_channels(
    self, turn_context: TurnContext
):
    channels = await TeamsInfo.get_team_channels(turn_context)
    reply = MessageFactory.text(f"Total of {len(channels)} channels are currently in team")
    await turn_context.send_activity(reply)
```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

You can directly issue a GET request on `/v3/teams/{teamId}/conversations`, using the value of `serviceUrl` as the endpoint. The value of `serviceUrl` is stable but can change. When a new message arrives, your bot must verify its stored value for `serviceUrl`.

```http
GET /v3/teams/19%3A033451497ea84fcc83d17ed7fb08a1b6%40thread.skype/conversations

Response body
{
    "conversations": [{
        "id": "19:033451497ea84fcc83d17ed7fb08a1b6@thread.skype",
        "name": null
    }, {
        "id": "19:cc25e4aae50746ecbb11473bba24c70a@thread.skype",
        "name": "Materials"
    }, {
        "id": "19:b7b84cba410c406ba671dbbf5e0a3519@thread.skype",

        "name": "Marketing"
    }]
}
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following tools installed and configured:

| Install | For using... |
| --- | --- |
| [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python build environments. Use the latest version. |
| [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) | Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest version.|
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Version control system to manage different versions of code within a repository. |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, refer to the "Node.js version compatibility table for project type" in the Teams Toolkit documentation. |
| [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | Platform to collaborate using apps for chat, meetings, and calls. |
| [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) or [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/portal) | Create your OpenAI API key to use OpenAI's GPT. If you need to host your app or access resources in Azure, create an Azure OpenAI service. |
| [Microsoft&nbsp;Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | Browser with developer tools. |
| [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with permissions to install an app and enable custom Teams apps and custom app uploading. |

<br/>
If you have run the samples before or encounter a runtime error, take these actions to ensure a fresh setup:

* Check all the `.env` and `env/.env.*.*` files in the sample and delete any automatically populated values. This action ensures that Teams Toolkit generates new resources.
* If you prefer not to let Teams Toolkit generate the app ID and password, update the `BOT_ID` and `BOT_PASSWORD` in the `.env` file with your custom values.
* Remove any values or leave blank the **SECRET_BOT_PASSWORD** and **TEAMS_APP_UPDATE_TIME** entries in the `.env` file to avoid conflicts.

Note that Teams Toolkit automatically provisions `BOT_ID` and `BOT_PASSWORD` resources. When you use your own resources, manually add them into the `.env` file. Teams Toolkit does not auto-generate the following resources:

* An Azure OpenAI or OpenAI key
* A database or similar storage options

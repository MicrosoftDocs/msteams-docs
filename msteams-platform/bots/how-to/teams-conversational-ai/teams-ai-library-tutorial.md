# Build a custom engine agent

This tutorial shows how to create a custom engine agent using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit) with OpenAI.

In this tutorial, learn:

* How to create a new custom engine agent with Agents Toolkit.
* How to interact with your Large Language Models (LLMs) and data.
* How the project workspace of your custom engine agent is structured.
* How to configure your custom engine agent and test it in Agent Playground

> [!NOTE]
>
> * Custom engine agent support for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is available only in [Public developer preview for Teams](../../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md)
> * Custom engine agent isn't supported in Python.

## Prerequisites

<details>
<summary><b>Ensure you install the following tools for building and deploying your apps.</b></summary>

| Install | For using... |
| --- | --- |
| [Agents Toolkit](~/toolkit/install-Teams-Toolkit.md) | A Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest version. |
| [Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://nodejs.org/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
| [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
| [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, or SharePoint Framework (SPFx) build environments. Use the latest version. |
| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application) |First create your OpenAI API key to use OpenAI's  Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). If you want to host your app or access resources in Microsoft Azure, you must create an [Azure OpenAI service](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) before you begin. |

<summary><b>Customize the prompt for your custom engine agent.</b></summary>

After you create your custom engine agent, let's configure it.

1. Go to `src/prompts/chat/skprompt.txt` and update the following code in `skprompt.txt` file:

    ```skprompt.txt
    The following is a conversation with an AI assistant, who is an expert on answering questions over the given context.
    Responses should be in a short journalistic style with no more than 80 words. 
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/prompts-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows skprompt in explorer in Visual Studio Code.a":::

1. From the left pane, select **Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D)**.

1. Select **Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to debug in either Teams or Copilot, select **"Debug in Teams** or **Debug in Copilot**.

1. Select the **F5** key.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/debug-in-test-tool.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the debug in Agents Playground.":::

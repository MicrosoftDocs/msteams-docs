## Function calls using AI SDK

Function calls, implemented within the AI SDK, unlock numerous capabilities, enabling the AI model to generate accurate responses seamlessly. It enables direct connection with external tools, thereby making AI even more powerful. These capabilities include performing complex calculations, retrieving important data, creating smoother workflows, and enabling dynamic interactions with users.

> [!NOTE]
> Structured outputs aren't supported.

To use function calling with the Chat Completions API:

1. Set up the planner where the default prompt uses the Tools Augmentation. Update one of the following files of your bot app:

    * For a JavaScript app: Update `index.ts`.
    * For a C# bot app: Update `Program.cs`.
    * For a Python app: Update `bot.py`.

   The following code snippet shows how to set up the `ToolsAugmentation` class:

   # [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

    ```JavaScript
    const planner = new ActionPlanner({
        model,
        prompts,
        defaultPrompt: 'tools'
    });
    ```

   # [C#](#tab/dotnet)

    ```C#
    ActionPlannerOptions<TurnState> options = new ActionPlannerOptions<TurnState>() 
    { 
        Model = model,
        Prompts = prompts,
        async (context, state, planner) =>
        {
            return await Task.FromResult(prompts.GetPrompt("Tools"));
        } 
    }
    ActionPlanner<TurnState> planner = new ActionPlanner(options)
    ```

   # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```Python
    planner = ActionPlanner(ActionPlannerOptions(model=model, prompts=prompts, default_prompt="tools"))
    ```

    ---

1. Specify tools augmentation in the `config.json` file.

    ```JSON
    {
        "schema": 1.1,
        "description": "",
        "type": "",
        "completion": {
    +       "tool_choice": "auto",
    +       "parallel_tool_calls": true,
        },
    +    "augmentation": {
    +        "augmentation_type": "tools"
    +    }
    }
    ```

1. Specify all your `function definitions` in the `actions.json` file, which is in the `prompts` folder. Ensure that you follow the schema to avoid errors when the action is called by the LLM.

    ```JSON
    [{
        "name": "CreateList",
        "description": "Creates a list"
    }]
    ```

1. Register your `handlers` in your `application` class.

    * Each handler is a callback function that runs when a specific event happens. The function call handler executes code in response to the event.
    * The function call must return a string as the output of the function call.
    * When the model requests to invoke any functions, these are mapped to `DO` commands within a `Plan` and are invoked in the AI class `run` function. The outputs are then returned to the model with tool call IDs to show that the tools were used.

   The following code snippet shows how to register `handlers`:

   # [JavaScript](#tab/javascript1)

    ```JavaScript
    app.ai.action("createList", async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, parameters: ListAndItems) => {
    // Ex. create a list with name "Grocery Shopping".
    ensureListExists(state, parameters.list);
    return `list created and items added. think about your next action`;
    });
    ```

   # [C#](#tab/dotnet1)

    ```C#
    [Action("CreateList")]
    public string CreateList([ActionTurnState] ListState turnState, [ActionParameters] Dictionary<string, object> parameters)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(turnState);
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(parameters);

        string listName = GetParameterString(parameters, "list");

        EnsureListExists(turnState, listName);

        return "list created. think about your next action";
    }
    ```

   # [Python](#tab/python1)

    ```Python
    @app.ai.action("createList")
    async def create_list(context: ActionTurnContext, state: AppTurnState):
    ensure_list_exists(state, context.data["list"])
    # Continues exectuion of next command in the plan.
    return ""
    ```

    ---

### Enable tool options

You can enable the following tool options:

* **Enable Tool Choice**: Allow the model to select the function it must call by enabling tool selection. In the `config.json` file:

  * Set `tool_choice` as `required` to mandate the model to always call at least one function.
  * Set `tool_choice` to a specific function using its definition for using that function.
  * Set `tool_choice` as `none` to disable the tool.

  The default value of `tool_choice`is `auto`. It enables the model to select the functions that it must call.

* **Toggle Parallel Tool Calls**: Executing tools in parallel is faster and reduces the number of back-and-forth calls to the API. In the `config.json` file, you can set `parallel_tool_calls` to `true` or `false`. By default, the `parallel_tool_calls` parameter is set to `true`.

The following code snippet shows how to enable tool choice and to toggle parallel tool calls:

```JSON
{

    "schema": 1.1,
    "description": "",
    "type": "",
    "completion": {
+       "tool_choice": "auto",
+       "parallel_tool_calls": true,
    },
+    "augmentation": {
+        "augmentation_type": "tools"
+    }
}
```

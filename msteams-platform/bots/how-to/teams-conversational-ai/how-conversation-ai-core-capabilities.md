# Bot overview

Bots are software applications that interact with users through text-based conversations. Bots follow predefined rules to answer questions or perform specific tasks. AI-powered bots use artificial intelligence to understand natural language, engage in complex conversations, and handle a wider range of tasks. Bots range from simple scripts to advanced AI systems that learn and adapt. Teams bots serve as virtual assistants within Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365.

Bot apps offer a range of business advantages:

1. **Automation**: Bots manage repetitive tasks, saving time and effort by handling routine processes automatically.
1. **Availability**: Bots operate continuously without requiring breaks, ensuring consistent support.
1. **Efficiency**: Bots manage multiple tasks simultaneously, which improves overall operational efficiency.
1. **Customer engagement**: Bots interact directly with customers, providing instantaneous responses and support.
1. **Scalability**: Bots scale to handle increased tasks or interactions as user needs evolve, making them adaptable.

## How do bots work?

A Teams bot processes user messages by following a set of predefined rules or leveraging AI to understand and address requests. When a user sends a message, the bot evaluates the input, determines the user's need, and then delivers a response or executes an action.

The following example demonstrates a simple Teams bot that executes short commands from users:

### Bots - the developer experience

Developers build bots to automate repetitive tasks and enhance both efficiency and user engagement. The image illustrates the development process for creating a Teams bot that meets specific user requirements:

### Understand bot development basics

Developers work with several core elements to create effective bots within Teams. Each element contributes to the bot's overall functionality:

* **Activity handler**: This component manages and processes activities generated by user interactions. Activities include text or image messages, bot events like users joining or leaving, @mentions, and user actions such as booking or ordering through the bot. The activity handler also manages error handling.
* **Event**: An event represents an occurrence triggered by user interaction with a bot. Events prompt the bot to respond or take a specific action. Examples include sending a message, clicking a button, or providing an input.
* **Conversation**: A conversation is an interactive exchange between the user and the bot. It involves text or voice messaging, capturing user inputs, and delivering appropriate responses while maintaining context and state. It also covers the user's intent, which guides the dialogue.
* **Bot logic**: Bot logic forms the core of the conversation management. It works with the activity handler to make decisions based on predefined rules, conditions, and contextual factors that determine the bot's responses.
* **Bot scope**: Bot scope defines the bot's functionality and its interactive range within Microsoft Teams. Developers deploy bots in three ways: as a personal chatbot, within a group chat, or within a channel.

### Explore bot capabilities

Developers can create bot apps with one or more specialized capabilities using either the Bot Framework SDK or the Teams AI library with Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (previously known as Teams Toolkit). Each capability meets distinct user needs:

* **Custom engine agent**:  
  A custom engine agent uses AI to automate tasks and understand natural language. It engages in conversations and answers questions, making it ideal for virtual assistance, language translation, predictive analysis, and more. Developers build AI-enabled Teams bots with custom AI models via this approach.
  
  * Use [Teams AI library v2 (preview)](/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/welcome) to add advanced features to your agents.
  * For more information, see [how to build a custom engine agent](../Teams-AI-library-tutorial.yml).

* **Conventional bots**:  

  * **Conversational bot**:  
    A conversational bot facilitates interactive engagements by simulating natural interactions with users. It helps users interact with a web service using text, interactive cards, and dialogs. It understands user inputs and crafts appropriate responses, making it useful for virtual assistance and customer service.

    For more information, see [how to create Teams conversation bot](../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

  * **Notification bot**:  
    A notification bot automates the process of sending alerts within Teams channels, group chats, or personal chats. It delivers reminders, alerts, and updates, and users can respond to options or links embedded in the notifications. This bot type enhances communication and timely updates.

    For more information, see [how to build notification bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-notificationbot.yml).

  * **Workflow bot**:  
    A workflow bot automates business processes by interacting with users, applications, and data. It manages tasks and workflows, automates repetitive chores, assigns work, tracks progress, and improves efficiency, reducing manual effort.

    For more information, see [how to build workflow bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-workflow-bot.yml).

  * **Command bot**:  
    A command bot automates responses to simple chat commands. With the Agents Toolkit, developers create a command bot template that displays its UI using an Adaptive Card. This approach ensures that command execution is efficient and clear.

    For more information, see [build command bot with JavaScript](../sbs-gs-commandbot.yml).

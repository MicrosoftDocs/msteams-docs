# Agents user experience

[!INCLUDE [teams-ai-lib-v2-rec](../../../includes/teams-ai-lib-v2-rec.md)]

An agent transforms system interactions. Developers create exceptional user experiences by following these guidelines. This article describes steps, principles, and considerations to design intuitive, user-centered interfaces that integrate AI capabilities. Goals include simplifying complex tasks, enhancing productivity, and offering personalized experiences through adaptive learning. An agent includes features that enhance functionality and integration within Teams environment:
<!--the Microsoft ecosystem-->

- **Generative AI integration**: Uses advanced AI models for natural language processing and interaction.
<!--
- **Bots**: Allows building or extending bots with LLM and generative AI for high-quality chat experiences.-->
- **Customizable orchestration**: Provides extensive customization options for tailoring the agent's behavior and responses to specific use cases.

To achieve this, you must follow mandatory requirements and best practices. For more information, see [validation guidelines for agents](../../../concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/review-copilot-validation-guidelines.md).

## Ensure mandatory requirements for an agent in Teams

The following requirements are mandatory for building the agent UX:

- [Update the app manifest an agent](#update-the-app-manifest-an-agent)
- [Stream the agent response to the user](#stream-the-agent-response-to-the-user)
- [Ensure the agent response contains citations](#ensure-the-agent-response-contains-citations)
- [Ensure the agent response contains an AI label](#ensure-the-agent-response-contains-an-ai-label)
- [Ensure that the agent maintains intelligent conversation](#ensure-that-the-agent-maintains-intelligent-conversation)
- [Ensure that the agent offers prompt starters or a welcome card](#ensure-that-the-agent-offers-prompt-starters-or-a-welcome-card)

<!--
> [!NOTE]
>
> - AI label, citation, feedback buttons, and sensitivity label are available for bots in personal chats, group chats, and channels.
-->

### Update the app manifest an agent

You must update the app manifest for the agent to define specific properties and configurations that characterize its capabilities and behavior.

Here's an example for updating the app manifest. You must add the `botID` property to the `copilotAgents` node in the app manifest.

<details>
<summary>App manifest update example:</summary>

```json
    "bots": [
        { 
          "botId": "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444", 
          // ... existing bot node fields
        } 
      ],
      "copilotAgents": {
        "customEngineAgents": [{ // New 
          "type": "bot", // Only option 
          "id": "00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444"  // Validated against bots node 
        }] 
      },

```

</details>

### Stream the agent response to the user

An agent uses LLM for complex user requests, which may delay responses. To prevent noticeable delays, stream responses to the user so they appear quickly.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-streaming-ux.gif" alt-text="Graphical representation shows streaming agent messages" border="false":::

Use the following types of updates while streaming responses:

- Informative updates: Send information on sub-steps as the agent generates the response before sending the final output.
- Response streaming: Send intermediate states of the final response while the LLM creates its full reply.

Use [Teams SDK](/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/) to add streaming to the agent.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Streaming bot messages is available only for one-on-one chats and in [public developer preview](../../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

### Ensure the agent response contains citations

Users must know the sources an agent uses to generate its final response. Identifying these resources allows users to validate and trust the responses.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-citation.png" alt-text="Image shows an example of citations in agents." border="false":::

Use [Teams SDK](/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/) to add streaming to the agent.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Citations with Adaptive Cards are available in [public developer preview](../../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

### Ensure the agent response contains an AI label

An agent must identify that it uses AI. Indicating that a response is AI-generated helps build trust in its capabilities. To ensure this, include a flag in each AI-generated response to denote that it was generated by AI. This flag automatically adds an AI label next to the response.

Examples of AI label:

- Example of AI-generated label:

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-labels-1.png" alt-text="Image shows an example of AI label for AI-generated message." border="false":::

- Example of sensitivity label:

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-labels-2.png" alt-text="Image shows an example of AI label for a confidential message." border="false":::

Use [Teams SDK](/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library/) to add streaming to the agent.

### Ensure that the agent maintains intelligent conversation

An agent tracks conversation context and history to provide intelligent interactions. It meets user expectations by maintaining awareness of the conversation and allowing references to previous messages and responses.

Use Teams SDK to ensure intelligent context-based conversation and to manage and pass conversational history and context to the LLM. Teams SDK enables you to:

- **Manage context and conversation history**: Ensure that the agent can track context and conversation history.
- **Identify conversation location**: Ensure the agent is aware of the platform where the conversation is occurring, such as on Teams, copilot.com, in a meeting side panel, or a group chat.
- **Store and pass conversation history**: Determine how to store and pass part of the conversation history to the agent.
- **Understand user references**: Ensure that when a user sends a message, the agent understands what the user is referring to. Build this understanding using LLM and recent conversation history. The agent mustn't require users to reestablish context with every message.

### Ensure that the agent offers prompt starters or a welcome card

An agent assists users by offering prompt suggestions that help them utilize its features effectively. This approach helps users overcome challenges during both initial and subsequent interactions.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-zero-prompts.png" alt-text="Image shows an example of prompt starters." border="false":::

- **Prompt starters**: Display initial prompt suggestions when an agent is added to a new conversation, whether in a one-on-one chat, a new session, or a group chat. These prompts must be tailored to the user's context and to the specific conversation thread.
- **Contextual prompts**: Present dynamic recommendations during user interactions. These prompts appear via contextual flyouts, such as **View Prompts** in one-on-one chats and @mention flyouts in group chats. They update to remain relevant to the ongoing conversation.
- **Suggested action**: Show prompts as pills above the compose box in one-on-one chats and as action buttons in group chats. These suggestions must be customized to match the agent's response.

## Best practices for agents in Teams

The following best practices help enhance the overall effectiveness of an agent:

- [Ensure that agent's response contains feedback button](#ensure-that-agents-response-contains-feedback-button).
- [Enable Teams Azure AD single sign-on](#enable-teams-azure-ad-single-sign-on).
- [Enable the agent to understand conversational history and context](#enable-the-agent-to-understand-conversational-history-and-context).
- [Offer dynamic and contextual suggestion prompts](#offer-dynamic-and-contextual-suggestion-prompts).
- [Enable app profile card](#enable-app-profile-card).

### Ensure that agent's response contains feedback button

Develop capability in the agent to receive user feedback. This functionality collects valuable insights that identify areas for improvement. Incorporate feedback to continuously refine and enhance bot responses, leading to more effective and user-friendly interactions.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-feedback-loop.png" alt-text="Image shows an example of feedback loop." border="false":::

To collect user feedback, you must:

- Provide feedback buttons with every response.
- Provide the feedback received from the user to the agent.
- Use the feedback to improve the quality of the agent's responses.

Use Teams SDK to add the feedback button property to the AI module. This property automatically adds a feedback button to each AI-generated message.

> [!NOTE]
> Customizable feedback forms are available in [public developer preview](../../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md).

### Enable Teams Azure AD single sign-on

Add single sign-on (SSO) authentication to your agent. For more information, see [enable SSO for your app](../authentication/bot-sso-overview.md).

### Enable the agent to understand conversational history and context

Design your agent to reference conversational history and context. This approach ensures that every interaction remains relevant and tailored to the user's specific needs. The agent references context and offers responses that are accurate and appropriate.

### Offer dynamic and contextual suggestion prompts

Enhance your agent's user experience with intelligent and context-aware prompts. The agent dynamically offers relevant suggestions based on conversation context and history.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-suggested-prompts.png" alt-text="Image shows an example of suggested prompts." border="false":::

To achieve this, the agent leverages conversation context and history so that prompt suggestions remain timely and fit for the query.

### Enable app profile card

> [!NOTE]
> Enable app profile card is available in [public developer preview](../../../resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md) for Teams apps.

Add hovercard experience for all agents and bots to provide valuable and relevant information that educates users about the app and its features.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/contoso-app-profile-card.png" alt-text="Image shows app profile card." border="false" lightbox="../../../assets/images/bots/contoso-app-profile-card.png":::

To enable app profile card for your agents or bots, add the `features` field under the `description` field in the app manifest. For more information, see [public developer preview for Teams](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/root-description?view=m365-app-prev&tabs=syntax&preserve-view=true).

# Conversation events in your Teams bot

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-bots.md)]

When building your conversational bots for Microsoft Teams, you can work with conversation events. Teams sends notifications to your bot for conversation events that happen in scopes where your bot is active. You can capture these events in your code and take the following actions:

* Trigger a welcome message when your bot is added to a team.
* Trigger a welcome message when a new team member is added or removed.
* Trigger a notification when a channel is created, renamed, or deleted.
* When a bot message is liked by a user.

## Conversation update events

You can use conversation update events to provide better notifications and more effective bot actions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * You can add new events any time and your bot begins to receive them.
> * You must design your bot to receive unexpected events.
> * If you are using the Bot Framework SDK, your bot automatically responds with a `200 - OK` to any events you choose not to handle.

A bot receives a `conversationUpdate` event in either of the following cases:

* When bot has been added to a conversation.
* Other members are added to or removed from a conversation.
* Conversation metadata has changed.

The `conversationUpdate` event is sent to your bot when it receives information on membership updates for teams where it has been added. It also receives an update when it has been added for the first time for personal conversations.

The following table shows a list of Teams conversation update events with more details:

| Action taken        | EventType         | Method called              | Description                | Scope |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----- |
| Channel created     | channelCreated    | OnTeamsChannelCreatedAsync | [A channel is created](#channel-created). | Team |
| Channel renamed     | channelRenamed    | OnTeamsChannelRenamedAsync | [A channel is renamed](#channel-renamed). | Team |

| Team restored        | teamRestored      | OnTeamsTeamRestoredAsync    | [A team is restored](#team-restored)       | Team |

### Channel created

The channel created event is sent to your bot whenever a new channel is created in a team where your bot is installed.

The following code shows an example of channel created event:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsChannelCreatedAsync(ChannelInfo channelInfo, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var heroCard = new HeroCard(text: $"{channelInfo.Name} is the Channel created");
    await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(heroCard.ToAttachment()), cancellationToken);
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

<!-- From sample: botbuilder-js\libraries\botbuilder\tests\teams\conversationUpdate\src\conversationUpdateBot.ts -->

```typescript

export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.onTeamsChannelCreatedEvent(async (channelInfo: ChannelInfo, teamInfo: TeamInfo, turnContext: TurnContext, next: () => Promise<void>): Promise<void> => {
            const card = CardFactory.heroCard('Channel Created', `${channelInfo.name} is the Channel created`);
            const message = MessageFactory.attachment(card);
            await turnContext.sendActivity(message);
            await next();
        });
    }
}

```

		MessageFactory.text(
			f"The new channel is {channel_info.name}. The channel id is {channel_info.id}"
		)
	)
```

### Channel renamed

The channel renamed event is sent to your bot whenever a channel is renamed in a team where your bot is installed.

The following code shows an example of channel renamed event:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsChannelRenamedAsync(ChannelInfo channelInfo, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var heroCard = new HeroCard(text: $"{channelInfo.Name} is the new Channel name");
    await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(heroCard.ToAttachment()), cancellationToken);
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.onTeamsChannelRenamedEvent(async (channelInfo: ChannelInfo, teamInfo: TeamInfo, turnContext: TurnContext, next: () => Promise<void>): Promise<void> => {
            const card = CardFactory.heroCard('Channel Renamed', `${channelInfo.name} is the new Channel name`);
            const message = MessageFactory.attachment(card);
            await turnContext.sendActivity(message);
            await next();
        });

### Channel deleted

The channel deleted event is sent to your bot whenever a channel is deleted in a team where your bot is installed.

The following code shows an example of channel deleted event:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsChannelDeletedAsync(ChannelInfo channelInfo, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var heroCard = new HeroCard(text: $"{channelInfo.Name} is the Channel deleted");
    await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(heroCard.ToAttachment()), cancellationToken);
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.onTeamsChannelDeletedEvent(async (channelInfo: ChannelInfo, teamInfo: TeamInfo, turnContext: TurnContext, next: () => Promise<void>): Promise<void> => {
            const card = CardFactory.heroCard('Channel Deleted', `${channelInfo.name} is the Channel deleted`);
            const message = MessageFactory.attachment(card);
            await turnContext.sendActivity(message);
            await next();
        });
    }
}

```

### Channel restored

The channel restored event is sent to your bot whenever a channel that was previously deleted is restored in a team where your bot is already installed.

The following code shows an example of channel restored event:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsChannelRestoredAsync(ChannelInfo channelInfo, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    var heroCard = new HeroCard(text: $"{channelInfo.Name} is the Channel restored.");
    await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(heroCard.ToAttachment()), cancellationToken);
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

<!-- From sample: botbuilder-js\libraries\botbuilder\tests\teams\conversationUpdate\src\conversationUpdateBot.ts -->

```typescript

export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.onTeamsChannelRestoredEvent(async (channelInfo: ChannelInfo, teamInfo: TeamInfo, turnContext: TurnContext, next: () => Promise<void>): Promise<void> => {
            const card = CardFactory.heroCard('Channel Restored', `${channelInfo.name} is the Channel restored`);
            const message = MessageFactory.attachment(card);
            await turnContext.sendActivity(message);
            await next();
        });
    }
}

```

# [JSON](#tab/json)

			f"The restored channel is {channel_info.name}. The channel id is {channel_info.id}"
		)
	)
```

### Team members added

The `teamMemberAdded` event is sent to your bot the first time it is added to a conversation. The event is sent to your bot every time a new user is added to a team or group chat where your bot is installed. The user information that is ID is unique for your bot and can be cached for future use by your service, such as sending a message to a specific user.

The following code shows an example of team members added event:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsMembersAddedAsync(IList<TeamsChannelAccount> teamsMembersAdded , TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    foreach (TeamsChannelAccount member in teamsMembersAdded)
    {
        if (member.Id == turnContext.Activity.Recipient.Id)
        {
            // Send a message to introduce the bot to the team
            var heroCard = new HeroCard(text: $"The {member.Name} bot has joined {teamInfo.Name}");
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(heroCard.ToAttachment()), cancellationToken);
        }
        else
        {
            var heroCard = new HeroCard(text: $"{member.Name} joined {teamInfo.Name}");
            await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(MessageFactory.Attachment(heroCard.ToAttachment()), cancellationToken);
        }
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.onTeamsMembersAddedEvent(async (membersAdded: ChannelAccount[], teamInfo: TeamInfo, turnContext: TurnContext, next: () => Promise<void>): Promise<void> => {
                let newMembers: string = '';
                console.log(JSON.stringify(membersAdded));
                membersAdded.forEach((account) => {
                    newMembers += account.id + ' ';
                });
                const name = !teamInfo ? 'not in team' : teamInfo.name;
                const card = CardFactory.heroCard('Account Added', `${newMembers} joined ${name}.`);
                const message = MessageFactory.attachment(card);
                await turnContext.sendActivity(message);
                await next();
        });
    }
}

```

			MessageFactory.text(f"Welcome your new team member {member.id}")
		)
	return
```

### Team members removed

The `teamMemberRemoved` event is sent to your bot if it is removed from a team. The event is sent to your bot every time any user is removed from a team where your bot is a member. To determine if the new member removed was the bot itself or a user, check the `Activity` object of the `turnContext`.  If the `Id` field of the `MembersRemoved` object is the same as the `Id` field of the `Recipient` object, then the member removed is the bot, else it is a user. The bot's `Id` generally is `28:<MicrosoftAppId>`.

> [!NOTE]
> When a user is permanently deleted from a tenant, `membersRemoved conversationUpdate` event is triggered.

The following code shows an example of team members removed event:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnTeamsMembersRemovedAsync(IList<ChannelAccount> membersRemoved, TeamInfo teamInfo, ITurnContext<IConversationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{

	)
```

Now that you have worked with the conversation update events, you can understand the message reaction events that occur for different reactions to a message.

## Message reaction events

The `messageReaction` event is sent when a user adds or removes reactions to a message which was sent by your bot. The `replyToId` contains the ID of the message, and the `Type` is the type of reaction in text format. The types of reactions include angry, heart, laugh, like, sad, and surprised. This event does not contain the contents of the original message. If processing reactions to your messages is important for your bot, you must store the messages when you send them. The following table provides more information about the event type and payload objects:

| EventType       | Payload object   | Description                                                             | Scope |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| messageReaction | reactionsAdded   | [Reactions added to bot message](#reactions-added-to-bot-message).           | All   |
| messageReaction | reactionsRemoved | [Reactions removed from bot message](#reactions-removed-from-bot-message). | All |

### Reactions added to bot message

The following code shows an example of reactions to a bot message:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnReactionsAddedAsync(IList<MessageReaction> messageReactions, ITurnContext<IMessageReactionActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    foreach (var reaction in messageReactions)
    {
      var newReaction = $"You reacted with '{reaction.Type}' to the following message: '{turnContext.Activity.ReplyToId}'";
      var replyActivity = MessageFactory.Text(newReaction);
      var resourceResponse = await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(replyActivity, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

<!-- Verify -->

```typescript

export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.onReactionsAdded(async (context, next) => {
           const reactionsAdded = context.activity.reactionsAdded;
            if (reactionsAdded && reactionsAdded.length > 0) {
                for (let i = 0; i < reactionsAdded.length; i++) {
                    const reaction = reactionsAdded[i];
                    const newReaction = `You reacted with '${reaction.type}' to the following message: '${context.activity.replyToId}'`;
                    const resourceResponse = context.sendActivity(newReaction);
                    // Save information about the sent message and its ID (resourceResponse.id).
                }
            }
        });
    }

### Reactions removed from bot message

The following code shows an example of reactions removed from bot message:

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task OnReactionsRemovedAsync(IList<MessageReaction> messageReactions, ITurnContext<IMessageReactionActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    foreach (var reaction in messageReactions)
    {
      var newReaction = $"You removed the reaction '{reaction.Type}' from the following message: '{turnContext.Activity.ReplyToId}'";
      var replyActivity = MessageFactory.Text(newReaction);
      var resourceResponse = await turnContext.SendActivityAsync(replyActivity, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

# [TypeScript](#tab/typescript)

<!-- Verify -->

```typescript
export class MyBot extends TeamsActivityHandler {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.onReactionsRemoved(async(context,next)=>{
            const reactionsRemoved = context.activity.reactionsRemoved;
            if (reactionsRemoved && reactionsRemoved.length > 0) {
                for (let i = 0; i < reactionsRemoved.length; i++) {
                    const reaction = reactionsRemoved[i];
                    const newReaction = `You removed the reaction '${reaction.type}' from the message: '${context.activity.replyToId}'`;
                    const resourceResponse = context.sendActivity(newReaction);
                    // Save information about the sent message and its ID (resourceResponse.id).

## Installation update event

The bot receives an `installationUpdate` event when you install a bot to a conversation thread. Uninstallation of the bot from the thread also triggers the event. On installing a bot, the **action** field in the event is set to *add*, and when the bot is uninstalled the **action** field is set to *remove*.
 
> [!NOTE]
> When you upgrade an application, and then add or remove a bot, the action also triggers the `installationUpdate` event. The **action** field is set to *add-upgrade* if you add a bot or *remove-upgrade* if you remove a bot. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installation update events are in developer preview today and will be Generally Available (GA) in March 2021. To see the installation update events, you can move your Teams client to public developer preview, and add your app personally or to a team or a chat.

### Install update event
Use the `installationUpdate` event to send an introductory message from your bot on installation. This event helps you to meet your privacy and data retention requirements. You can also clean up and delete user or thread data when the bot is uninstalled.

# [C#](#tab/dotnet)

```csharp
protected override async Task
OnInstallationUpdateActivityAsync(ITurnContext<IInstallationUpdateActivity> turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {
var activity = turnContext.Activity; if
(string.Equals(activity.Action, "Add",
StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)) {
// TO:DO Installation workflow }
else
{ // TO:DO Uninstallation workflow
} return; }
```

You can also use a dedicated handler for *add* or *remove* scenarios as an alternative method to capture an event.

```csharp
protected override async Task
OnInstallationUpdateAddAsync(ITurnContext<IInstallationUpdateActivity>
turnContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken) {
// TO:DO Installation workflow return;
}
```

# Configure your app in Azure AD

Azure AD provides app users access to your bot or message extension app. The app user who has signed into Teams can be given access to your app.

## Enable SSO in Azure AD

The bot and message extension apps use Bot Framework for implementing authentication. You must create and configure a bot resource and an app in Azure AD portal.

The first step to enable SSO for your bot resource is to configure it in the Azure AD. You can enable SSO for your Teams bot app in two ways:

- **Configure SSO using bot resource**:
  - Create bot resource ID and an app ID (You can also link it to the app ID of an already registered app).
  - Configure messaging endpoint and OAuth connection for the bot resource.
  - Configure access token, app ID URI, and trusted client IDs for the linked Azure AD app.
  - Create client secret
- **Configure SSO using Azure AD app**:
  - Register your app with Azure AD and configure access token, app ID URI, trusted client IDs, and client secret.
  - Configure bot resource using the app ID generated by Azure AD when you registered your app.
  - Create a bot resource and configure messaging endpoint and OAuth connection for it.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have configured:

- Application ID
- Bot ID
- Access token
  - Application ID URI
  - Scope, permissions, and authorized client IDs
  - client secret
- Messaging endpoint and OAuth settings

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you've created an app and a bot resource in Azure AD.
> - For more information about creating an app in Azure AD, see [To register a new app in Azure AD](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-register-a-new-app-in-azure-ad).
> - For more information about creating and configuring your bot resource in Azure AD, see [Create Teams conversation bot](../../../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

Select one of the following two ways to configure your bot resource for SSO in Azure AD.

# [Configure SSO using bot resource](#tab/botid)

To configure your bot resource for enabling SSO in Azure AD:

- **[Configure messaging endpoint](#configure-messaging-endpoint)**
  - **[Configure your app for SSO in Azure AD](#configure-your-app-in-azure-ad)**: You'll need to register your app with Azure AD before you configure it. Then, to enable it for SSO:
    - Configure scope for access token, application ID URI, and trusted client IDs
    - Configure access token version
    - Create client secret
- **[Configure OAuth connection](#configure-oauth-connection)**

### Configure messaging endpoint

Messaging endpoint is where messages are sent to your bot. It enables communicate with your bot.

#### To configure messaging endpoint for your bot resource

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

1. Enter the name of your Azure AD app in **Search** box, and open your app.

1. Select **Settings** > **Configurations**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/bot-app-menu.png" alt-text="bot-config-menu.png":::

# [Configure SSO using Azure AD app](#tab/windows)

To create and configure your app for enabling SSO in Azure AD:

- [**Configure your Azure AD app**](#configure-your-azure-ad-app)
  - Configure scope for access token, application ID URI, and trusted client IDs
  - Configure access token version
  - Create client secret
- [**Configure bot resource in Azure AD**](#configure-bot-resource-in-azure-ad)
  - [To configure messaging endpoint](#to-configure-messaging-endpoint)
  - [To update OAuth connection](#to-update-oauth-connection-1)

## Configure your Azure AD app

You can configure the scope and permissions for access tokens in your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you've registered your app in Azure AD. At registration, Azure AD generates a new app ID that you must note. You'll need to update it later in the Teams app manifest file.

### Configure scope for access token

You must configure scope (permission) options for your Azure AD app. You need it for sending access token to Teams client and authorize trusted client applications.

To configure scope and authorize trusted client applications, you'll need:

- [To expose an API](#to-expose-an-api): Configure scope (permission) options for your app. You'll expose a web API, and configure the application ID URI.
- [To configure API scope](#to-configure-api-scope): Define scope for the API, and the users who can consent for a scope. You can let only admins provide consent for higher-privileged permissions.
- [To configure authorized client application](#to-configure-authorized-client-application): Create authorized client IDs for applications that you want to pre-authorize. It allows the app user to access the app scopes (permissions) you've configured, without requiring any further consent. Pre-authorize only those client applications you trust as your app users won't have the opportunity to decline consent.

#### To expose an API

1. Select **Manage** > **Expose an API** from the left pane.

    - The application ID URI format should be: `api://fully-qualified-domain-name.com/{AppID}`.
    - Insert the `fully-qualified-domain-name.com` between `api://` and `{AppID}` (which is, GUID). For example, api://example.com/{AppID}.

    where,
    - `fully-qualified-domain-name.com` is the human-readable domain name from which your bot app is served. Your application's domain name and the domain name you register for your Azure AD application should be the same.

      If you're using a tunneling service, such as ngrok, you must update this value whenever your ngrok subdomain changes.
    - `AppID` is the app ID (GUID) that was generated when you registered your app. You can view it in the **Overview** section.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > - **Application ID URI for app with multiple capabilities**: If you're building an app with a bot, a messaging extension, and a tab, enter the application ID URI as `api://fully-qualified-domain-name.com/BotId-{YourClientId}`, where the BotID is your bot app ID.

## Configure bot resource in Azure AD

To enable SSO for your bot resource:

- [To configure messaging endpoint](#to-configure-messaging-endpoint): Messaging endpoint is where messages are sent to your bot. It enables communication with your bot.
- [To update OAuth connection](#to-update-oauth-connection): For a bot to support SSO, you must update its OAuth connection settings. This process associates the bot with:

  - Azure AD application associated with the bot
  - The app's application ID URI
  - The permissions that the bot needs to obtain an access token

  With the Client ID and Client secret provided, the token store exchanges the token for a graph token with defined permissions.

You'll need to create a bot resource, create client secret, and enable it for Teams before enabling SSO. Note the client secret for your bot resource. You'll need to update it later to update OAuth connection.

Before you enable SSO for your bot app, you must create and configure your bot resource in Azure AD. For more information, see [Create Teams conversation bot](../../../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

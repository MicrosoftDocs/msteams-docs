# Configure your app in Azure AD

Azure AD provides app users access to your bot or message extension app. The app user who has signed in to Teams can be given access to your app.

## SSO configuration in Azure AD portal

The bot and message extension apps use Bot Framework for communicating with app users and implementing authentication.

To configure SSO for your bot or message extension app, you'll need to:

- Configure bot resource in Azure AD
- Configure app in Azure AD

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you've created an app and a bot resource in Azure AD.
>
> - For more information about creating an app in Azure AD, see [Register a new app in Azure AD](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-register-a-new-app-in-azure-ad).
> - For more information about creating and configuring your bot resource in Azure AD, see [Create Teams conversation bot](../../../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

You can configure your bot resource and app in Azure AD for your bot or message extension app in one of the following two ways:

- **Configure SSO using bot resource and configure Azure AD app**: You can start by configuring SSO for your bot resource, and enable SSO for your Azure AD app. You'll configure:

  - For bot resource: Messaging endpoint and OAuth connection.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create your bot resource in Azure AD, you can select the option for creating a new app ID, or you can use an existing app ID if you've already registered your app in Azure AD.

  - For Azure AD app: App ID URI, scope and permissions, trusted client IDs, access token version, client secret, and redirect URL.

- **Configure SSO using Azure AD app and then configuring bot resource**: You can start by configuring your Azure AD app, and then use this app ID in the bot resource when you enable SSO for it. You'll configure:

  - For Azure AD app: App ID URI, access token, trusted client IDs, access token version, client secret, and redirect URL.

  - For bot resource: Messaging endpoint and OAuth connection.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Configure bot resource using the app ID generated by Azure AD when you registered your app.

## Enable SSO in Azure AD

By the end of this tutorial, you'll learn to configure:

- Application ID
- Bot ID
- Access token
  - Application ID URI
  - Scope, permissions, and authorized client IDs
  - Client secret
  - Redirect URL
- Messaging endpoint and OAuth connection

Select one of the following two ways to configure SSO for your bot resource:

# [Use bot resource and configure Azure AD app](#tab/botid)

To enable SSO for your app in Azure AD:

- **[Configure messaging endpoint](#configure-messaging-endpoint)**
- **[Configure SSO for Azure AD app](#configure-sso-for-azure-ad-app)**:
  - [Configure scope for the access token](#configure-scope-for-the-access-token)
  - [Configure access token version](#configure-access-token-version)
  - [Create client secret](#create-client-secret)
  - [Configure redirect URL](#configure-redirect-url)
- **[Configure OAuth connection](#configure-oauth-connection)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that when you create your bot resource, select the option to create a new app ID. You can also use an existing app ID, if you've already registered an app in Azure AD portal.

## Configure messaging endpoint

Messaging endpoint is where messages are sent to your bot. It enables communication with your bot.

### To configure messaging endpoint for your bot resource

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

1. Enter the name of your bot resource in **Search** box, and select **Enter** to open it.

1. Select **Settings** > **Configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/bot-app-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the bot Configuration menu.":::

    The **Configuration** page appears.

1. Enter the messaging endpoint URL where your bot receives app user's messages.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/message-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Messaging endpoint option to add the URL where the bot interacts with the user." :::

1. Select **Apply**.

    The messaging endpoint is configured.

You've configured the messaging endpoint for your bot resource. Next, you must enable SSO for the Azure AD app.

## Configure SSO for Azure AD app

You must configure permissions and scopes, authorize client applications, update manifest, and create client secret for your Azure AD app. These configurations help to invoke SSO for your bot app.

### Configure scope for the access token

Configure scope (permission) options for sending access token to Teams client and authorizing trusted client applications to enable SSO.

You need:

- [To configure application ID URI](#to-configure-application-id-uri): Configure scope (permission) options for your app. You'll expose a web API and configure the application ID URI.
- [To configure API scope](#to-configure-api-scope): Define scope for the API, and the users who can consent for a scope. You can let only admins provide consent for higher-privileged permissions.
- [To configure authorized client application](#to-configure-authorized-client-application): Create authorized client IDs for applications that you want to pre-authorize. It allows the app user to access the app scopes (permissions) you've configured, without requiring any further consent. Pre-authorize only those client applications you trust, as your app users won't have the opportunity to decline consent.

#### To configure application ID URI

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.

   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

You've configured the client secret. Next, you must configure the redirect URL.

### Configure redirect URL

Configuration for authentication depends on the platform or device where you want to target your app. You may need to configure redirect URIs, authentication settings, or platform-specific details.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If your bot app hasn't been granted IT admin consent, app users have to provide consent the first time they use your app on a different platform.
> - Implicit grant is not required if SSO is enabled on a bot app.

You can configure authentication for multiple platforms as long as the URL is unique.

#### To configure redirect URL

1. Open the app you registered in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **Manage** > **Authentication** from the left pane.

    1. Enter the redirect URI. The URI should be unique.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The URL mentioned in **Redirect URIs** is an example.

    1. Enter the front-channel log-out URL.
    1. Select the tokens you want Azure AD to send for your app.

1. Select **Configure**.

    The platform is configured and displayed in the **Platform configurations** page.

The Azure AD app configuration is complete, and now you must enable SSO support for your bot resource by configuring OAuth connection.

## Configure OAuth connection

For a bot to support SSO, you must update its OAuth connection settings. This process associates the bot with app details that you configured for your Azure AD app:

- Azure AD app ID, which is the client ID
- Tenant ID
- Scope and permissions

With the app (client) ID and client secret provided, the Bot Framework Token Store exchanges the token for a graph token with defined permissions.

### To update OAuth connection

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

1. Enter the name of your Azure AD app in **Search** box, and open your app.

1. Select **Settings** > **Configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/bot-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the configure OAUth settings for your bot app." :::

    The **Configuration** page appears.

1. Move through the **Configuration** page and select **Add OAuth Connection Settings**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/bot-oauth-connection.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Add OAuth Connection Settings option highlighted.":::

    The **New Connection Setting** page appears.

1. Enter the OAuth configuration settings for the Azure bot.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/new-config-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the New Connection Setting to provide the details." :::

    1. Enter a name for the configuration setting.
    1. Select the service provider.

        The remaining configuration details appear.

        :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/new-config-setting-b.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the additional fields for New Connection Setting." :::

    1. Enter the app (client) ID for the Azure AD app.
    1. Enter the client secret that you've created for your bot.
    1. Enter the application ID URI of your bot in the **Token Exchange URL**.
    1. Enter the tenant ID.
    1. Enter the scope that you defined when you configured the scope and permissions.

1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Apply**.

    After you've configured the OAuth connection, you can select **Test connection** to check if the OAuth connection is successful.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/test-oauth.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Test OAuth connection for your bot resource option.":::

    If the connection isn't successful, Azure AD, displays an error. You can verify all configurations and test again.

Congratulations! You've completed the following app configurations in Azure AD required to enable SSO for your bot app:

- Application ID
- Bot ID
- Access token
  - Application ID URI
  - Scope, permissions, and authorized client IDs
  - Client secret
  - Redirect URL
- Messaging endpoint and OAuth connection

## Configure your Azure AD app for SSO

You must configure permissions and scopes, authorize client applications, update manifest, and create client secret for your Azure AD app. These configurations help invoke SSO for your bot app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you've [registered your app](../../../tabs/how-to/authentication/tab-sso-register-aad.md#to-register-a-new-app-in-azure-ad) in Azure AD. At registration, Azure AD generates a new app ID that you must note. You'll need to update it later in the Teams app manifest file.

### Configure scope for access token

You must configure scope (permission) options for your Azure AD app. You need it for sending access token to Teams client and authorize trusted client applications.

To configure scope and authorize trusted client applications, you'll need:

- [To configure application ID URI for your app](#to-configure-application-id-uri-for-your-app): Configure scope (permission) options for your app. You'll expose a web API and configure the application ID URI.
- [To configure API scope for your app](#to-configure-api-scope-for-your-app): Define scope for the API and the users who can consent for a scope. You can let only admins provide consent for higher-privileged permissions.
- [To configure an authorized client application](#to-configure-an-authorized-client-application): Create authorized client IDs for applications that you want to pre-authorize. It allows the app user to access the app scopes (permissions) you've configured, without requiring any further consent. Pre-authorize only those client applications you trust as your app users won't have the opportunity to decline consent.

1. Enter the appropriate Microsoft 365 client ID for the applications that you want to authorize for your app’s web application.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-tabs/add-client-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Client ID added." :::

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - The Microsoft 365 client IDs for mobile, desktop, and web applications for Teams, Microsoft 365 app, and Outlook are the actual IDs that you must add.
    > - If your app has a tab app, you'll need either web or SPA, as you can't have a mobile or desktop client application in Teams.

1. Choose one of the following client IDs:

   | Use client ID | For authorizing... |
   | --- | --- |
   | 1fec8e78-bce4-4aaf-ab1b-5451cc387264 | Teams mobile or desktop application |

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/add-client-secret.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Add a client secret page to provide the required details." :::

    1. Enter the description.
    1. Select the duration of validity for the secret.

1. Select **Add**.

   A message appears on the browser stating that the client secret was updated, and the client secret displays on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/client-secret-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Client secret added message.":::

1. Select the copy button next to the **Value** of client secret.
1. Save the value that you copied. You'll need it later for updating code.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Ensure that you copy the value of client secret right after you create it. The value is visible only at the time when the client secret is created, and it can't be viewed after that.

### Configure redirect URL for your app

Configuration for authentication depends on the platform or device where you want to target your app. You may need to configure redirect URIs, authentication settings, or platform-specific details.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If your bot app hasn't been granted IT admin consent, app users have to provide consent the first time they use your app on a different platform.
> - Implicit grant is not required if SSO is enabled on a bot app.

You can configure authentication for multiple platforms as long as the URL is unique.

#### To configure redirect URL for your app

1. Open the app you registered in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).

1. Select **Manage** > **Authentication** from the left pane.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/azure-portal-platform.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Authentication option under Manage." :::

    The **Platform configurations** page appears.

1. Select **+ Add a platform**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/add-platform.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Add a platform option under Authentication." :::

    The **Configure platforms** page appears.

1. Select the platform that you want to configure for your app. You can choose the platform type from web or SPA.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/configure-platform.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the selection of web platform." :::

    The **Configure Web** page appears.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The configurations will be different based on the platform you select.

1. Enter the configuration details for the platform.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/config-web-platform.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Configure Web page to provide inputs." :::

    1. Enter the redirect URI. The URI should be unique.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The URL mentioned in **Redirect URIs** is an example.

    1. Enter the front-channel logout URL.
    1. Select the tokens you want Azure AD to send for your app.

1. Select **Configure**.

    The platform is configured and displayed in the **Platform configurations** page.

The configuration for Azure AD app is complete, and now you can configure your bot resource for enabling SSO.

## Configure bot resource in Azure AD

Before you enable SSO for your bot app, you must create and configure your bot resource in Azure AD. For more information, see [Create Teams conversation bot](../../../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml).

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that when you create your bot resource, you select the application ID of your Azure AD app that you registered.

To enable SSO for your bot resource:

- [Configure messaging endpoint for your bot resource](#configure-messaging-endpoint-for-your-bot-resource)
- [Configure OAuth connection for your bot resource](#configure-oauth-connection-for-your-bot-resource)

### Configure messaging endpoint for your bot resource

Messaging endpoint is where messages are sent to your bot. It enables communication with your bot.

#### To configure messaging endpoint

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

1. Enter the name of your bot resource in **Search** box, and select **Enter** to open it.

1. Select **Settings** > **Configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/bot-app-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the bot Configuration menu.":::

    The **Configuration** page appears.

1. Enter the messaging endpoint URL where your bot receives app user's messages.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/message-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Messaging endpoint option to add the URL where the bot interacts with the user." :::

1. Select **Apply**.

    The messaging endpoint is configured.

Now, you must configure the OAuth connection to enable SSO for your bot resource.

### Configure OAuth connection for your bot resource

For a bot to support SSO, you must update its OAuth connection settings. This process associates the bot with app details that you configured for your Azure AD app:

- Azure AD app ID, which is the client ID
- Tenant ID
- Scope and permissions

With the app (client) ID and client secret provided, the Bot Framework Token Store exchanges the token for a graph token with defined permissions.

#### To update OAuth connection for your bot resource

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) on your web browser.
   The Microsoft Azure Bot page opens.

1. Enter the name of your Azure AD app in **Search** box, and open your app.

1. Select **Settings** > **Configuration**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/bot-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the configure OAUth settings for your bot app." :::

    The **Configuration** page appears.

1. Move through the **Configuration** page and select **Add OAuth Connection Settings**.

    The **New Connection Setting** page appears.

1. Enter the OAuth configuration settings for the Azure bot.

    :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/new-config-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the New Connection Setting to provide the details." :::

    1. Enter a name for the configuration setting.
    1. Select the service provider.

        The remaining configuration details appear.

        :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/new-config-setting-b.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the additional fields for New Connection Setting." :::

    1. Enter the client ID that was generated when you created the bot app.
    1. Enter the client secret that you've created for your bot.
    1. Enter the application ID URI of your bot in the **Token Exchange URL**.
    1. Enter the tenant ID.
    1. Enter the scope that you defined when you configured the permissions.

        > [!NOTE]
        > For this tutorial, you can use openid profile User.Read User.ReadBasic.All as scope. This scope is suitable for using the [Code sample](bot-sso-code.md#code-sample).

1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Apply**.

After you've configured the OAuth connection, you can select **Test connection** to check if the OAuth connection is successful.

:::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/test-oauth.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Test OAuth connection for your bot resource option.":::

If the connection isn't successful, Azure AD, displays an error. You can verify all configurations and test again.

Congratulations! You've completed the following app configurations in Azure AD required to enable SSO for your bot app:

- Application ID
- Bot ID
- Access token
  - Application ID URI
  - Scope, permissions, and authorized client IDs
  - Client secret
  - Redirect URL
- Messaging endpoint and OAuth connection

## Best practices

- Keep the Azure AD app registration restricted to its original purpose of service to service application.
- Create an additional Azure AD app for any user to service authentication, for more finite control over disabling authentication connections, rolling secrets, or reusing the Azure AD app with other applications.

Some of the problems you encounter if you also use the Azure AD registration app for authentication are:

- If the certificate attached to the Azure AD app registration needs to be renewed, it would impact users that have authenticated with other Azure AD services using the certificate.
- It creates a single point of failure and control for all authentication-related activities with the bot.

# Extend your app with Microsoft Graph permissions and scopes

You can extend your bot and message extension apps by using Microsoft Graph. These permissions can allow app users to view user profile, to read mail, and more. Your app must ask for specific permission scopes to obtain the access tokens on app user's consent.

Graph scopes, such as `User.Read` or `Mail.Read`, lets you specify how your app accesses a Teams user's account. You need to specify your scopes in the authorization request.

In this section, you'll learn to [Configure API permissions in Microsoft Entra ID](#configure-api-permissions-in-azure-ad).

## Configure API permissions in Microsoft Entra ID

You can configure Graph scopes in Microsoft Entra ID as required for your app. Delegated permissions are used by apps that require signed-in access. An app user or administrator who is signed-in must consent to them. Your app can consent on behalf of the signed-in user when it calls Microsoft Graph.

### To configure API permissions

1. Open the app you registered in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).

2. Select **Manage** > **API permissions** from the left pane.

    You can also enter the permission name in the search box to find it.

    A message appears on the browser stating that the permissions were updated.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/updated-permission-msg.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the permissions updated message." :::

    The added permissions are displayed in the **API permissions** page.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/authentication/teams-sso-bots/configured-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the configured API permissions." :::

    You've configured your app with Microsoft Graph permissions.

After you've completed the configuration in Microsoft Entra ID, you must update the code to acquire access token for Microsoft Graph. For more information, see [Bot framework SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-teams-authentication/csharp/SimpleGraphClient.cs).

The app user is prompted to consent for Graph permissions on the first time they use it. After the app user gives consent, the Graph permissions are granted. For more information on Graph API permissions, see [permissions and consent](/azure/active-directory/develop/permissions-consent-overview).

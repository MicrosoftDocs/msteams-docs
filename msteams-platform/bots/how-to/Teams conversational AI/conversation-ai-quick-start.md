# Teams AI library quick start guide

Get started with Teams AI library using the LightBot sample, which is designed to help you through the process of creating apps that can control lights, such as turning them on and off using Teams AI library. The bot uses the gpt-3.5-turbo model to chat with Microsoft Teams users and respond in a polite and respectful manner, staying within the scope of the conversation.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure that you have the following tools:

| Install | For using... |
| --- | --- |
| [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) | JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python build environments. Use the latest version. |
| [Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) | Microsoft Visual Studio Code extension that creates a project scaffolding for your app. Use the latest version.|
|[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)|Git is a version control system that helps you manage different versions of code within a repository. |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) | Back-end JavaScript runtime environment. For more information, see [Node.js version compatibility table for project type](~/toolkit/build-environments.md#nodejs-version-compatibility-table-for-project-type).|
| [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app) | To collaborate with everyone, you work with apps for chat, meetings, and call all in one place.|
| [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) or [Azure OpenAI](https://oai.azure.com/portal)| First create your OpenAI API key to use OpenAI's GPT. If you want to host your app or access resources in Microsoft Azure, you must create an Azure OpenAI service.|
| [Microsoft&nbsp;Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) (recommended) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) | A browser with developer tools. |
| [Microsoft 365 developer account](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) | Access to Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app and [enable custom Teams apps and turn on custom app uploading](../../../concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant.md#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading). |

<br/>
If you've already run the samples before or encountered a runtime error, follow these steps to start fresh:

* Check all the `.env` and `env/.env.*.*` files in the sample and delete any automatically populated values to ensure that Teams Toolkit generates new resources for you.
* If you don’t want Teams Toolkit to generate the app ID and password, update the `BOT_ID` and `BOT_PASSWORD` in the `.env` file with your own values.
* Remove values or leave the values blank for  **SECRET_BOT_PASSWORD** and **TEAMS_APP_UPDATE_TIME** in the `.env` file to avoid conflicts.

Teams Toolkit automatically provisions `BOT_ID` and `BOT_PASSWORD` resources. If you want to use your own resources, you need to manually add them to the `.env` file. Teams Toolkit doesn't auto-generate the following resources:

* An Azure OpenAI or OpenAI key
* A database or similar storage options

## Build and run the sample app

Get started with Teams AI library using the LightBot sample. It enables your computer’s localhost to quickly execute a Teams AI library-based sample.

1. Go to the [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/js/samples).

1. Run the following command to clone the repository:

   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai.git
   ```

1. Go to **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Select **File** > **Open Folder**.

1. Go to the location where you cloned teams-ai repo and select the **teams-ai** folder.

1. Select **Select Folder**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/ai-library-dot-net-select-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the teams-ai folder and the Select Folder option.":::

1. Select **View** > **Terminal**. A terminal window opens.

1. In the terminal window, run the following command to go to the **js** folder:

   ```
   cd .\js\
   ```

1. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```terminal
   yarn install
   ```

1. Run the following command to build dependencies:

   ```terminal
   yarn build
   ```

1. After the dependencies are installed, select **File** > **Open Folder**.

1. Go to **teams-ai > js > samples> 03.ai-concepts> c.actionMapping-lightBot** and select **Select Folder**. All the files for the LightBot sample are listed under the **EXPLORER** section in Visual Studio Code.

1. Update the following steps based on the AI services you select.

   # [OpenAI key](#tab/OpenAI-key)

   1. Go to the `env` folder and update the following code in `./env/.env.local.user` file:

      ```text
       SECRET_OPENAI_KEY=<your OpenAI key>
      ```
   1. Go to the `infra` folder and ensure that the following lines in the `azure.bicep` file are commented out:

      ```bicep
          // {
          //   name: 'AZURE_OPENAI_KEY'
          //   value: azureOpenAIKey
          // }
          // {
          //   name: 'AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT'
          //   value: azureOpenAIEndpoint
          // }
      ```

   # [Azure OpenAI](#tab/Azure-OpenAI)

   1. Go to the `env` folder and update the following code in `./env/.env.local.user` file:

       ```text
       SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<your Azure OpenAI key>
       SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your Azure OpenAI Endpoint>
       ```

   1. Go to the `teamsapp.local.yml` file and modify the last step to use Azure OpenAI variables:

       ```yaml
          - uses: file/createOrUpdateEnvironmentFile
            with:
             target: ./.env
             envs:
             BOT_ID: ${{BOT_ID}}
             BOT_PASSWORD: ${{SECRET_BOT_PASSWORD}}
             #OPENAI_KEY: ${{SECRET_OPENAI_KEY}}
             AZURE_OPENAI_KEY: ${{SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY}}
             AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT: ${{SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}}
       ```

   1. Go to the `infra` folder and ensure that the following lines in the `azure.bicep` file are commented out:

      ```bicep
          // {
          //  name: 'OPENAI_KEY'
          //  value: openAIKey
          // }
      ```

   1. Go to `infra` > `azure.parameters.json` and replace the lines from [20 to 22](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/03.ai-concepts/c.actionMapping-lightBot/infra/azure.parameters.json#L20-L22) with the following code:

         ```json
            "azureOpenAIKey": {
            "value": "${{SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_KEY}}"
            },
            "azureOpenAIEndpoint": {
            "value": "${{SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}}"
            }
           ```
    ---

1. From the left pane, select **Teams Toolkit**.

1. Under **ACCOUNTS**, sign-in to the following:

   * **Microsoft 365 account**
   * **Azure account**

1. To debug your app, select the **F5** key.

   A browser tab opens a Teams web client requesting to add the bot to your tenant.

1. Select **Add**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/lightbot-add.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows adding the LightBot app.":::

   A chat window opens.

1. In the message compose area, send a message to invoke the bot.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../assets/images/bots/lightbot-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of the LightBot output." lightbox="../../../assets/images/bots/lightbot-output.png":::

> [!NOTE]

## Additional tools

You can also use the following tools to run and set up a sample:

1. **Teams Toolkit CLI**: You can use the Teams Toolkit CLI to create and manage Teams apps from the command line. For more information, see [Teams Toolkit CLI set up instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/getting-started/OTHER/TEAMS-TOOLKIT-CLI.md).

1. **Bot Framework Emulator**: The [Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator) is a desktop application that allows you to test and debug your bot locally. You can connect to your bot by entering the bot’s endpoint URL and Microsoft app ID and password. You can then send messages to your bot and see its responses in real-time. For more information, see [Bot Framework Emulator set up instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/getting-started/OTHER/BOTFRAMEWORK-EMULATOR.md).

1. **Manual setup**: If you prefer to set up your resources manually, you can do so by following the instructions provided by the respective services. For more information, see [manual set up instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/getting-started/OTHER/MANUAL-RESOURCE-SETUP.md).

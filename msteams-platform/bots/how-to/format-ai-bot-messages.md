# Format AI bot messages

If you're building a conversational bot, you can now leverage features such as citations and feedback buttons that enable better user engagement. For AI-powered bots, you can now add AI label and sensitivity label that can help you build trust and transparency with users.

Here's a quick overview on each feature that you can integrate to your bot message:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | :---: |
| [AI label](#ai-label) | Enables user to identify that the message was generated using AI. |
| [Sensitivity label](#sensitivity-label) | Enables user to understand the confidentiality of the bot's message. |
| [Citations](#citations) | Enables user to refer to the source of the bot's message through in-text citations and a list of references. |
| [Feedback buttons](#feedback-buttons) | Enables user to provide positive or negative feedback based on their experience. |

## AI label

AI label added to your bot message specifies that the message is generated by AI. AI bots use large language models (LLMs) that are generally reliable, however, it's crucial to add an AI label to maintain user's trust in your bot.

To add an AI label to your bot message, modify the message to include `additionalType` field under the `entities` object.

The following code snippet shows how to add an AI label to your bot's message:

```json
{ 
    "type": "message", 
    "from": { 
        "id": "28:48b2e1fd-b6b8-46ce-8074-8e918304fcb2" 
    }, 
    "conversation": { 
        "isGroup": true, 
        "id": "19:88b15596-2dd4-440b-98c6-a19cf49455a1@thread.tacv2" 
    }, 
    "recipient": { 
        "id": "8:orgid:f20c2a2c-1b43-416a-b5e8-fbcc69387c5e" 
    }, 
    "text": "2fd50566-ad63-4237-b240-f1942f7bdeb6", 
    "attachments": [], 
    "entities": [ 
        { 
            "@type": "Message", 
            "@context": "https://schema.org", 
            "@id": "", 
            "additionalType": [ 
                "AIGeneratedContent" 
            ] 
        } 
    ] 
}
```

For a bot built using Teams AI library, Teams automatically enables AI label to all AI-powered bot messages. Teams AI library enables the flag to include the AI label button in all activities sent via the AI module in `PredictedSAYCommand`.

In an AI-bot built with JavaScript, the code that automatically adds this flag can be found in `SayCommand.ts`. If you want to add this flag manually, add the following code:

<!--```javascript
await context.sendActivity({
         type: ActivityTypes.Message,
         text: `Hey I'm a friendly AI bot. This message is generated via AI - ${txt}`,
        entities: [
          {
            type: "https://schema.org/Message",
            "@type": "Message",
            "@context": "https://schema.org",
            additionalType: ["AIGeneratedContent"], // AI Generated label
          }
        ]
       });
```-->

```json
{
    "type": ActivityTypes.Message,
    "text": // ...
    // ... other properties
    "entities": [
        {
            "type": "https://schema.org/Message",
            "@type": "Message",
            "@context": "https://schema.org",
            /**
              * Must be left blank. This is for Bot Framework schema.
              */
            "@id": "",
            /**
              * Indicate that the content was generated by AI.
              */
            "additionalType": ["AIGeneratedContent"]
        }
    ]
}
```

To learn more about how to add the flag manually and modify `PredictedSAYCommand`, see [Modify PredictedSAYCommand](#modify-predictedsaycommand).

After an AI label is added, your bot’s message automatically display an **AI-generated** label next to the bot’s name with a hover disclaimer stating **AI-generated content may be incorrect**. The label and hover disclaimer can't be modified.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/ai-bot-label.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot shows an AI bot label.":::

## Sensitivity label

Bot responses might contain information that's confidential or only accessible to certain individuals within the organization. You must add a sensitivity label to help users identify the confidentiality of a message, enabling them to exercise caution when sharing the message.

> [!NOTE]
> Add this label to your bot's messages only if it contains sensitive information.

To add sensitivity label to your bot message, modify the message to include `usageInfo` in the `entities` object.

The following code snippet shows how to add the sensitivity label to your bot's message:

```json
{ 
    "type": "message", 
    "from": { 
        "id": "28:48b2e1fd-b6b8-46ce-8074-8e918304fcb2" 
    }, 
    "conversation": { 
        "isGroup": true, 
        "id": "19:751e0de5-9729-4182-882c-1cf98c5ea3d4@thread.tacv2" 
    }, 
    "recipient": { 
        "id": "8:orgid:db0778ad-ed6c-4e21-b98c-896ec6ad7ed0" 
    }, 
    "text": "ea2492cd-f768-41ad-a1ae-8f356c7cca28", 
    "attachments": [], 
    "entities": [ 
        { 
            "@type": "Message", 
            "@context": "https://schema.org", 
            "@id": "", 
            "usageInfo": { 
                "@type": "CreativeWork", 
                "description": "Sensitivity description", 
                "name": "Sensitivity name" 
            } 
        } 
    ] 
}
```

For a bot built using Teams AI library, Teams displays a sensitivity label when the message includes `usageInfo` in the `entities` object.

The following code snippet shows the sensitivity label added to your bot's message:

```javascript
await context.sendActivity({
         type: ActivityTypes.Message,
         text: `Hey I'm a friendly AI bot. This mesasge is generated via AI - ${txt}`,
        entities: [
          {
            type: "https://schema.org/Message",
            "@type": "Message",
            "@context": "https://schema.org",
            usageInfo: {
              "@type": "CreativeWork",
              description: "Please be mindful of sharing outside of your team", // Sensitivity description
              name: "Confidential \\ Contoso FTE", // Sensitivity title
            },
          },
        ],
```

After the sensitivity label is added, your bot message contains a shield icon. Users can hover over the icon to find a disclaimer message on the sensitivity of the message.

### Error handling

| Error code | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Multiple root message entities found in the bot activity. |
| 400 | Error parsing message entity from activity object. |
| 400 | No usage info to link for a message level usage info. |
| 400 | Multiple usage info to link for a message level usage info. |

## Citations

It's important to cite the sources of the bot message that helps users to ask follow-up questions or conduct independent research. Citing the data sources such as files, messages, emails, and work items build trust and enables users to get valuable insights. Citations are important for bots using techniques like RAG.

Citations to your bot message include:

* [In-text citations](#add-in-text-citations) to cite your text using the [X] format at any point within the text.
* [Citation reference list](#add-citation-reference) to list the corresponding references of the in-text citations.

### Add in-text citations

In-text citations appear as numbers, each corresponding to a reference that can include the title, keywords, an abstract (or excerpt), hyperlink, and sensitivity information. References for these in-text citations appear as pop-ups and as expandable citation footers. A citation can be inserted anywhere within the text.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/ai-bot-inline-citation.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot shows an AI bot response with in-text citation.":::

The following code snippet shows the format of in-text citations to be added to your bot's message:

```javascript
await context.sendActivity({
    type: ActivityTypes.Message,
    text: 'Hey I'm a friendly AI bot. This message is generated via AI - $(txt) [1]', // cite with [1]
});
```

### Add citation reference

Citation references are an indexed list that corresponds to in-text citations. This list provides key details such as the title of the citation, the link to the source, and a relevant quote from the source.

To add a citation reference list to your bot message, include `citation` array in the `entities` object, as shown in the following code snippet:

```json
{
    "type": "message",
    "from": {
        "id": "28:48b2e1fd-b6b8-46ce-8074-8e918304fcb2"
    },
    "conversation": {
        "isGroup": true,
        "id": "19:136c757a-88d8-48c1-829d-3007c9f684b0@thread.tacv2"
    },
    "recipient": {
        "id": "8:orgid:7e425333-960e-4d3e-b136-0e98701ff5cc"
    },
    "textFormat": "plain",
    "text": "c53a7514-4abb-4592-b882-c2d0fac6f5bb[1];",
    "attachments": [],
    "entities": [
        {
            "@type": "Message",
            "@context": "https://schema.org",
            "@id": "",
            "citation": [
                { 
                    "@type": "Claim",
                    "position": 1,
                    "appearance": {
                        "@type": "DigitalDocument",
                        "name": "Name 1",
                        "url": "https://example.com/claim-1",
                        "abstract": "Abstract 1",
                        "keywords": [
                            "Keyword1 - 1",
                            "Keyword1 - 2",
                            "Keyword1 - 3"
                        ],
                        "usageInfo": {
                            "@type": "CreativeWork",
                            "description": "UsageInfo 1 description",
                            "name": "UsageInfo 1"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

For a bot built using Teams AI library, Teams displays the citations when the message includes `citation` array in the `entities` object.

The following code snippet shows the citation reference added to your bot's message:

```javascript
 await context.sendActivity({
         type: ActivityTypes.Message,
        text: `Hey I'm a friendly AI bot. This message is generated via AI - $(txt) [1]`, // cite with [1]
        entities: [
          {
            type: "https://schema.org/Message",
            "@type": "Message",
            "@context": "https://schema.org",
            "@id": "",
            citation: [
              {
                "@type": "Claim",
                position: 1, // Required. Should match the [1] in the text above
                appearance: {
                  "@type": "DigitalDocument",
                  name: "Some secret citation", // Title
                  url: "https://example.com/claim-1", // Hyperlink on the title
                  abstract: "Excerpt", // Excerpt (abstract)
                  keywords: ["Keyword1 - 1", "Keyword1 - 2", "Keyword1 - 3"], // Keywords
                  usageInfo: {
                    "@type": "CreativeWork",
                    name: "Confidential \\ Contoso FTE", // Sensitivity title
                    description: "Only accessible to Contoso FTE", // Sensitivity description
                  },
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
}
```

After you enable citations, the bot's message includes the in-text citations and a reference list in the footer. The in-text citations display the reference details when users hover over them, as shown in the following image:

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/ai-bot-ref-cite-list.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot shows an AI bot reference citation list.":::

You can add sensitivity labels to citations to indicate the confidentiality of the content referenced. To enable sensitivity labels for citations, modify the message to include `usageInfo` in the `entities` object.

The following code snippet shows the sensitivity labels in citations of your bot's message:

```json
{ 
    "type": "message", 
    "from": { 
        "id": "28:48b2e1fd-b6b8-46ce-8074-8e918304fcb2" 
    }, 
    "conversation": { 
        "isGroup": true, 
        "id": "19:5a5faeb2-8967-4469-b306-9a319072f96f@thread.tacv2" 
    }, 
    "recipient": { 
        "id": "8:orgid:209f94ff-7f34-42a2-883e-5dafc6a7d2f8" 
    }, 
    "textFormat": "plain", 
    "text": "1721a2f9-c79e-4502-b62e-ae31189ba17e[1];", 
    "attachments": [], 
    "entities": [ 
        { 
            "@type": "Message", 
            "@context": "https://schema.org", 
            "@id": "", 
            "citation": [ 
                { 
                    "@type": "Claim", 
                    "position": 1, 
                    "appearance": { 
                        "@type": "DigitalDocument", 
                        "name": "Name 1", 
                        "usageInfo": { 
                            "@type": "CreativeWork", 
                            "@id": "usage-info-1", 
                            "description": "UsageInfo 1 description", 
                            "name": "UsageInfo 1" 
                        } 
                    } 
                } 
            ], 
            "usageInfo": { 
                "@type": "CreativeWork", 
                "@id": "usage-info-1" 
            } 
        } 
    ] 
}
```

### Error handling

| Error code | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Multiple root message entities found in the bot activity. |
| 400 | Error parsing message entity from activity object. |
| 400 | Bot message with more than 10 citations. |
| 400 | Claim added has empty appearance. |
| 400 | Error while parsing citation entity with ID: X. |

## Feedback buttons

Feedback buttons in bot messages are crucial for measuring user engagement, identifying errors, and gaining insights into your bot's performance in real-world scenarios. This can lead to targeted and effective enhancements of your bot’s conversational capabilities. You must enable feedback buttons for the users to like or dislike messages and also provide detailed feedback.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-feedback-buttons.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot shows the feedback buttons in a bot.":::

When the user selects a feedback button, a respective feedback form appears based on the user's selection.

# [👍Positive feedback](#tab/pos)

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/bots/bot-feedback-form.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot shows the feedback form in a bot.":::

# [👎Negative feedback](#tab/neg)

*Image placeholder*

---

### Enable feedback buttons

To enable feedback buttons in your bot, add a new `channelData` object in your bot's message and set `feedbackLoopEnabled` to true.

The following code snippet shows how to enable feedback buttons in a bot:

```json
{
    "type": "message",
    "from": {
        "id": "28:48b2e1fd-b6b8-46ce-8074-8e918304fcb2"
    },
    "conversation": {
        "isGroup": true,
        "id": "19:21e795db-9804-4bb8-9a6a-f85b9e8e9602@thread.tacv2"
    },
    "recipient": {
        "id": "8:orgid:67cc58d0-4a80-496a-a019-437b70bc6529"
    },
    "text": "93001cd5-45f4-4a9a-b694-0f44eecfd004",
    "attachments": [],
    "entities": [],
    "channelData": {
        "feedbackLoopEnabled": true
    }
}

```

For a bot built using Teams AI library, Teams enables feedback buttons to all bot messages when `enable_feedback_loop` is set to `true` in the `ai` object.

```javascript
export const app = new Application<ApplicationTurnState>({
    ai: {
        planner: planner,
        enable_feedback_loop: true
    },
```

[Sample code reference](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/blob/main/js/samples/04.ai-apps/h.datasource-azureOpenAI/src/app.ts)

After you enable feedback buttons, all SAY commands from the bot have `feedbackLoopEnabled` automatically set to `true` in the `channelData` object.

```javascript
await context.sendActivity({
  type: ActivityTypes.Message,
  text: `Hey I'm a friendly AI bot. This message is generated via AI - ${txt}`,
  channelData: {
    feedbackLoopEnabled: true // Enable feedback buttons
  },
});
```

Feedback buttons are located at the footer of the bot’s message, and include a 👍 (thumbs up) and a 👎 (thumbs down) button for the user to choose from. You can collect feedback on bot responses from personal chats, group chats, and channels.

The bot sends the user's input, received in the feedback form, through a bot invoke. The following code snippet shows a bot invoke containing positive feedback from a user:

```json
{
 "name": "message/submitAction",
 "conversation": {
  "id": "19:144de878089f94d7db699d10a4672bc040@thread.v2"
 },
 "value": {
  "actionName": "feedback",
  "actionValue": {
    "reaction": "like",
    "feedback": "test feedback"
  }
 }
}
```

The following code snippet shows a bot invoke containing feedback from a user for a bot built using Teams AI library:

```javascript
{
    "actionName: "feedback",
    "actionValue": {
        "reaction": string, //"like" or "dislike"
        "feedback": string
    },
    "replyToId": string
}

```

---

### Handle feedback

You need to have an `onInvokeActivity` handler to correctly process the invoke when the bot receives it. Ensure that you return a status code 200 with an empty response.

Teams automatically notifies the user that their feedback was submitted successfully. Therefore, don't send a message or notification to the user upon receiving feedback.

The following code snippet shows how to handle feedback received in a bot invoke and return a response with the status code 200:

***<placeholder_code snippet>***

If your bot is built using Teams AI library, the bot invoke received is automatically handled. To handle feedback, use the `app.feedbackLoop` method to register a feedback loop handler that is called when the user provides feedback.

```javascript
app.feedbackLoop(async (context, state, feedbackLoopData) => {
  // custom logic here...
});
```

It’s important to store feedback after you receive it. Hence, ensure that you store the message IDs and the content of the messages that your bot sends and receives. When your bot receives an invoke containing feedback, match the message ID of the bot’s message with the corresponding feedback.

> [!NOTE]
> Teams neither stores or processes feedback, nor does it provide an API or a storage mechanism.

If a user uninstalls your bot and still has access to the bot chat, Teams removes the feedback buttons from the bot's messages to prevent the user from providing feedback to the bot.

### Error handling

| Error code | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | When the `submit/messageAction` invoke response isn't empty |

## Modify PredictedSAYCommand

For a bout built using Teams AI library, the `PredictedSAYCommand` provides more control on how AI label, sensitivity label, citations, and feedback buttons are added to the bot's activity. To modify `PredictedSAYCommand`, use the following code:

```JavaScript
app.ai.action<PredictedSayCommand>(AI.SayCommandActionName, async (context, state, data, action) => {
  // custom logic here...
  await context.sendActivity(data.content);
  return "";
});
```

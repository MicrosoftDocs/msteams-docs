# Suggested prompts for bot

Suggested Prompts are commands that are presented to the users in the Microsoft Teams chat when they install your bot app. 

A key challenge user face when starting a conversation with bots is to understand how to interact with them. This challenge is more often with the bots that use AI library as users might not be familiar with their conversational nature or the different set of capabilities. So, it's important to help users onboard and explore how to use your bot. 

Suggested prompts create an engaging and insightful user experience and helps your bot acquire and retain users. Users can discover the value of your bot through prompt conversations.

There are two types of suggested prompts, prompt starters and suggested actions. Prompt starters help users start a conversation with your bot and [suggested actions](~/bots/how-to/conversations/conversation-messages.md#send-suggested-actions) help users continue conversations with your bot.

Prompt starters help users start conversations with your bot with prompts available in the chat window. Prompt starters are sourced from the [command menu](#create-a-command-menu-for-your-bot) in your bot's app manifest. When the user selects a command in the prompt starter, the title of the command is populated into the compose box. Post initial conversation the commands are available in the **View prompts** options above the compose box.

>[!NOTE]
> For Prompt Starters, bot shouldn't send a welcome message. The commands aren't displayed for the initial conversation if your bot sends a welcome message. 

Following is the UI for command menu, which is available in [public developer preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro.md):

## Create a command menu for your bot

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended that you'd create a command bot by following the step-by-step guide to [build command bot with JavaScript](../../sbs-gs-commandbot.yml) using the new generation development tool for Teams. For more information about Teams Toolkit, see [Teams Toolkit Overview for Visual Studio Code](../../toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals.md) and [Teams Toolkit overview for Visual Studio](../../toolkit/teams-toolkit-overview-visual-studio.md).

[!INCLUDE [pre-release-label](~/includes/v4-to-v3-pointer-bots.md)]

Command menus are defined in your app manifest. You can either use [**Developer Portal**](#create-a-command-menu-using-developer-portal) to create them or add them manually in the [app manifest](#create-a-command-menu-by-editing-manifestjson).

### Create a command menu using Developer Portal

A prerequisite to create a command menu for your bot is that you must edit an existing app manifest. The steps to add a command menu are the same, whether you create a new manifest or edit an existing one.

To create a command menu for your bot using Developer Portal:

1. Open Teams and select **Apps** from the left pane. In the **Apps** page, search for **Developer Portal**, and then select **Open**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tdp/add-dev-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add Developer Portal in Teams client.":::
  
1. In **Developer Portal**, select the **Apps** tab. If you don't have an existing app package, you can create or import an existing app. For more information, see [Developer Portal for Teams](../../concepts/build-and-test/teams-developer-portal.md).

1. Select **Apps** tab, select **App features** from the left pane, and then select **Bots**.

1. Select **Add a command** under **Commands** section.

   :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/tdp/add-a-bot-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add a command for your bot in Developer Portal.":::

1. Enter the **Command** that appears as the command menu for your bot.

1. Enter the **Description** that appears under the command text in the menu. **Description** must be a brief explanation of the purpose of the command.

1. Select the **Scope** check box and then select **Add**.
   This defines where the command menu must appear.

### Create a command menu by editing manifest.json

Another way to create a command menu is to create it directly in the manifest file while developing your bot source code. To use this method, follow these points:

* Each menu supports up to 10 commands.
* Create a single command menu that works in all scopes.
* Create a different command menu for each scope.

#### Manifest example for single menu for both scopes

The manifest example code for single menu for both scopes is as follows:

```json
{
  â‹®
  "bots":[
    {
      "botId":"[Microsoft App ID for your bot]",
      "scopes": [
        "personal",
        "team"
      ],
      "commandLists":[
        {
          "scopes":[
            "team",
            "personal"
          ],
          "commands":[
            {
              "title":"Help",
              "description":"Displays this help message"
            },
            {
              "title":"Search Flights",
              "description":"Search flights from Seattle to Phoenix May 2-5 departing after 3pm"
            },
            {
              "title":"Search Hotels",
              "description":"Search hotels in Portland tonight"
            },
            {
              "title":"Best Time to Fly",
              "description":"Best time to fly to London for a 5 day trip this summer"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

#### Manifest example for the menu for each scope

The manifest example code for the menu for each scope is as follows:

```json
{
  ...
  "bots":[
    {
      "botId":"<Microsoft app ID for your bot>",
      "scopes": [
        "groupChat",
        "team"
      ],
      "commandLists":[
        {
          "scopes":[
            "team"
          ],
          "commands":[
            {
            "title":"help",
            "description":"Displays this help message for channels"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "scopes":[
            "groupChat"
          ],
          "commands":[
            {
            "title":"help",
            "description":"Displays this help message for group chat"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  ...
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you remove any commands from your manifest, you must redeploy your app to implement the changes. In general, any changes to the manifest require you to redeploy your app.

You must handle menu commands in your bot code as you handle any message from users. You can handle menu commands in your bot code by parsing out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text.

## Handle menu commands in your bot code

Bots in a group or channel respond only when they're mentioned `@botname` in a message. Every message received by a bot when in a group or channel scope contains its name in the message text. Before handling the command being returned, your message parsing must handle the message received by a bot with its name.

> [!NOTE]
> To handle the commands in code, they are sent to your bot as a regular message. You must handle them as you would handle any other message from your users. The commands in code insert pre-configured text into the text box. The user must then send that text as they do for any other message.

* [Sample code reference](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-hello-world/csharp/Microsoft.Teams.Samples.HelloWorld.Web/Bots/MessageExtension.cs#L19)

You can parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text using a static method provided with the Microsoft Bot Framework. It's a method of the `Activity` class named `RemoveRecipientMention`.

The C# code to parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text is as follows:

```csharp
// Remove recipient mention text from Text property.
// Use with caution because this function is altering the text on the Activity.
var modifiedText = turnContext.Activity.RemoveRecipientMention();
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

You can parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text using a static method provided with the Bot Framework. It's a method of the `TurnContext` class named `removeMentionText`.

The JavaScript code to parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text is as follows:

```javascript
// Remove mention text from Text property, this function is altering the text on the Activity.
const modifiedText = TurnContext.removeMentionText(turnContext.activity, turnContext.activity.recipient.id);
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

You can parse out the **@Mention** portion of the message text using a static method provided with the Bot Framework. It's a method of the `TurnContext` class named `remove_recipient_mention`.

The Python code to parse out the **\@Mention** portion of the message text is as follows:

```python
# Remove recipient mention text from Text property, this function is altering the text on the Activity.
modified_text = TurnContext.remove_recipient_mention(turn_context.activity)
